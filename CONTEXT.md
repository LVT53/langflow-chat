# AlfyAI Product Context

AlfyAI is a conversational workspace where users can chat casually, use tools, work with files, and optionally start deeper background research tasks. This context captures product-domain language that should stay stable across implementation choices.

## Normal Chat Context

### Language

**Available Context**:
Conversation, workspace, memory, document, attachment, or task information that AlfyAI may consider for a **Normal Chat** turn.
_Avoid_: prompt, evidence, memory dump, active context

**Prompt Context**:
The subset of **Available Context** actually sent to the model for a specific **Normal Chat** turn.
_Avoid_: available context, all memory, workspace state

**Context Sources**:
The user-facing surface that shows documents, attachments, memory, prior turns, generated work, and other sources AlfyAI is considering or carrying forward.
_Avoid_: evidence manager, manual retrieval setup, budget manager

**Message Evidence**:
The user-facing audit of sources used or cited for one assistant message.
_Avoid_: context sources, carried-forward context, context manager

**Protected Context**:
Context that should survive budget pressure longer than ordinary context but still respects the **Context Budget**.
_Avoid_: essential context, mandatory context, unlimited context

**Context Selection**:
The per-turn process that chooses **Prompt Context** from **Available Context**.
_Avoid_: memory assembly, Honcho context, retrieval, prompt building

**Context Inclusion Level**:
The amount of an item of **Available Context** promoted into **Prompt Context** for a turn.
_Avoid_: mode, retrieval class, prompt size

**Reference Context**:
A **Context Inclusion Level** that includes only compact identifying details such as title, type, and relevance reason.
_Avoid_: metadata dump, citation, evidence

**Excerpt Context**:
A **Context Inclusion Level** that includes selected snippets relevant to the current turn.
_Avoid_: chunk dump, full document

**Task Context**:
A **Context Inclusion Level** that includes enough content to perform a requested document or workspace task.
_Avoid_: full context, unlimited context, entire file

**Omitted Context**:
Available information deliberately left out of **Prompt Context** for a turn.
_Avoid_: forgotten context, unavailable context

**Context Signal**:
A reason that an item of **Available Context** may be relevant to the current **Normal Chat** turn.
_Avoid_: guess, heuristic, vibe

**Weak Context Signal**:
A **Context Signal** that can help rank or break ties but should not promote context by itself.
_Avoid_: relevance, active context

**Strong Context Signal**:
A **Context Signal** strong enough to promote **Available Context** into **Prompt Context** when the turn budget allows.
_Avoid_: guarantee, always include

**Context Budget**:
The turn-specific ceiling for how much **Prompt Context** may be sent to the model.
_Avoid_: model limit, token dump

**Max Model Context**:
The model/provider-specific maximum context window AlfyAI may plan against.
_Avoid_: target context, compaction threshold, evidence budget

**Target Constructed Context**:
The configured target size for a Normal Chat turn's **Prompt Context** before final model-call overhead and response space.
_Avoid_: arbitrary evidence cap, fixed document limit, small-context mode

**Compaction Threshold**:
The configured point at which AlfyAI treats **Prompt Context** as large enough to show or record compaction pressure.
_Avoid_: hard evidence limit, maximum context, token warning

**Reserved Context Budget**:
The portion of **Context Budget** held for the current user message, system instructions, tool overhead, and response space.
_Avoid_: hidden budget, overhead

**Core Context Budget**:
The portion of **Context Budget** used for direct user-supplied or explicitly targeted context.
_Avoid_: essential budget, unlimited budget

**Support Context Budget**:
The portion of **Context Budget** used for relevant supporting context such as excerpts, recent turns, summaries, and retrieved evidence.
_Avoid_: extra context, filler

**Awareness Context Budget**:
The portion of **Context Budget** used for compact **Reference Context** about weaker but plausible items.
_Avoid_: metadata budget, weak context dump

**Context Trace**:
A structured operational diagnostic record of what became **Prompt Context** and why.
_Avoid_: debug log, chain of thought, hidden reasoning

**Context Diagnostics Debug**:
An explicit runtime setting that enables verbose context, retrieval, attachment, and TEI diagnostics beyond the compact **Context Trace**.
_Avoid_: trace on/off, noisy mode

**Context Limitation**:
A user-facing disclosure that an answer is based on partial or selected **Prompt Context**.
_Avoid_: error, apology, debug note

**Context Clarification**:
A user-facing question asked only when AlfyAI cannot choose usable **Prompt Context** automatically.
_Avoid_: context setup, retrieval prompt, settings question

**Context Selection Debt**:
Obsolete or duplicated context-selection behavior left behind after a newer **Context Selection** path replaces it.
_Avoid_: old code, junk, legacy stuff

**Context Selection Slice**:
An independently testable and verifiable increment that improves **Context Selection** behavior.
_Avoid_: phase, batch refactor, cleanup later

**Production Slice**:
A slice that is complete enough to operate reliably in production rather than only demonstrate a prototype path.
_Avoid_: demo slice, spike, partial path

### Relationships

- **Available Context** is broader than **Prompt Context**.
- **Prompt Context** is selected per **Normal Chat** turn.
- **Context Sources** explains and steers automatic context selection; it should not make the user manually budget context.
- **Context Sources** may expose pin and exclude controls as optional overrides.
- Pinning or excluding a **Context Source** is scoped to the current conversation or task by default.
- Global source preference is a separate future concept and should not be implied by ordinary pinning.
- **Context Sources** may summarize or group sources for a cleaner UI, but it should preserve enough detail for users to understand which important sources are being carried forward.
- **Context Sources** is conversation-level and compact.
- **Context Sources** should subtly indicate when active sources were compacted, reduced, or omitted because of budget pressure.
- **Message Evidence** is message-level and may stay attached to each assistant response.
- **Context Sources** should show the broader carried-forward pool, while **Message Evidence** shows what supported a specific answer.
- **Context Sources** should avoid unbounded lists by grouping, summarizing, or collapsing lower-priority sources.
- **Context Sources** should separate active sources from inferred available sources.
- Active **Context Sources** include current attachments, pinned sources, open or current documents, current generated documents, and strong task sources.
- Memory may appear in **Context Sources** as a compact separate group.
- Memory display should summarize source type or role rather than exposing long memory internals.
- Inferred available sources may be grouped or collapsed with counts and representative names.
- Active **Context Sources** should persist across turns until a clear topic shift, user reset, user exclusion, or task boundary change.
- Retrieval may resize and reprioritize active **Context Sources** each turn, but retrieval should not be the only memory of which sources define the conversation.
- Clear topic shifts may demote active **Context Sources** into inferred available sources.
- User reset or exclusion is stronger than topic-shift decay and may remove sources from the active pool.
- Smart decay or compaction may use a local control model when intelligence is useful.
- Local-model decay or compaction should avoid slowing ordinary response generation; prefer cached, bounded, asynchronous, or fallback-safe decisions.
- Smart compaction and decay are async-first and should usually run after a turn or during idle maintenance.
- During a chat turn, use deterministic fast rules unless a high-impact decision requires a short-timeout local-model check.
- Memory remains supporting context even for large-context models.
- Memory should stay compact and summary-oriented rather than expanding into long history dumps by default.
- **Protected Context** is not unlimited context.
- **Protected Context** may be downgraded to a smaller **Context Inclusion Level** when needed to fit the **Context Budget**.
- The current user message is reserved rather than merely protected.
- A direct attachment or explicitly targeted document may become **Protected Context**.
- Passive workspace state alone does not create **Protected Context**.
- **Context Selection** is the source of truth for promoting **Available Context** into **Prompt Context**.
- **Context Selection** considers conversation, memory, attachment, workspace, task, generated-file, generated-document, and retrieval signals together.
- Individual subsystems may supply **Available Context** and **Context Signals**, but should not independently force large text into **Prompt Context**.
- **Max Model Context** should be derived from provider/model metadata when available.
- Explicit admin **Max Model Context** values override derived provider/model defaults.
- If model capacity is unknown, AlfyAI should use a conservative known fallback or require admin configuration for that provider.
- **Target Constructed Context** and **Compaction Threshold** are the primary product controls for prompt size.
- **Target Constructed Context** and **Compaction Threshold** should be automatically derived from the selected model's usable context capacity by default.
- A good default is **Target Constructed Context** at about 90% of usable context capacity and **Compaction Threshold** at about 80% of usable context capacity.
- Derived context-size defaults are model- and provider-specific and should update when the active model changes.
- Explicit admin values for **Target Constructed Context** and **Compaction Threshold** override derived defaults.
- When those settings are unset, AlfyAI should use the model-derived defaults.
- Fixed item-count limits should not override **Target Constructed Context** when the configured model has enough context capacity.
- Candidate and rerank limits should scale with the configured context capacity or runtime policy instead of acting as hidden hard caps.
- Candidate and rerank limits are performance safeguards, not the source of truth for how many sources may enter **Prompt Context**.
- **Context Selection** may batch, widen, or bypass reranking for clearly active sources when model capacity allows.
- Cost-saving behavior should be an explicit admin or runtime policy, not an accidental consequence of small fixed evidence limits.
- Every promoted context item has a **Context Inclusion Level**.
- **Reference Context** preserves awareness without sending body content.
- **Excerpt Context** supports focused answers when only part of an item is relevant.
- **Task Context** is reserved for turns that require substantial document or workspace content.
- **Omitted Context** remains **Available Context** and may be promoted in a later turn.
- An open workspace document is **Available Context**.
- An open workspace document creates a **Weak Context Signal**.
- A **Weak Context Signal** may combine with user wording or explicit selection to become a **Strong Context Signal**.
- Passive workspace state alone should not promote a document into **Prompt Context**.
- Uncertainty should usually reduce the **Context Inclusion Level** rather than block the user.
- A **Context Clarification** is reserved for cases where the answer would materially depend on choosing between ambiguous context items.
- Attaching an item in the current turn is the strongest **Context Signal**.
- Current-turn attachments should be treated as active **Context Sources**.
- Current-turn attachments should receive near-full **Prompt Context** when they fit within model-scaled **Target Constructed Context**.
- Current-turn attachments should degrade by document structure or meaningful chunks before falling back to tiny excerpts.
- After the turn, uploaded or attached documents should remain active **Context Sources** for the conversation or task until they decay, are excluded, or a boundary change removes them.
- Explicitly naming an item is stronger than relying on workspace state.
- Deictic wording such as "this" or "it" is a **Strong Context Signal** only when paired with a clear available target.
- Correction or refinement wording can promote the current work item into **Prompt Context**.
- Pinned or preferred task evidence is stronger than ordinary retrieval but still subject to the **Context Budget**.
- Semantic or lexical retrieval alone should usually promote no more than **Excerpt Context**.
- An open workspace item alone should only break ties or produce **Reference Context**.
- Recency alone should rarely promote more than **Reference Context**.
- Pinned or preferred evidence is strongly preferred but still budgeted.
- Pinned or preferred evidence may become **Protected Context** when relevant to the turn.
- Pinned or preferred evidence still has a **Context Inclusion Level**.
- Irrelevant pinned evidence should not receive full body content.
- When multiple items are relevant, AlfyAI should preserve breadth before depth.
- Breadth means using **Reference Context** for plausible relevant items before spending large budget on any one item.
- Depth means using **Excerpt Context** or **Task Context** for the strongest item or explicitly requested comparison set.
- For explicitly supplied or active source sets, breadth means giving every source meaningful content before giving very deep content to the strongest sources.
- Explicitly supplied or active source sets should not lose entire documents because of small fixed item-count limits when the model-scaled **Context Budget** has room.
- By default, only one primary item should receive **Task Context** in a turn.
- Multiple items may receive large context when the user explicitly asks to compare or jointly transform them.
- Attaching an item makes it explicitly relevant but does not override the **Context Budget**.
- Attached items should use model-scaled **Context Budget** before being reduced to **Excerpt Context**.
- Large attached items may receive **Excerpt Context** only when the model-scaled budget is genuinely pressured or the user asks a narrowly targeted question.
- Multiple attached items should preserve breadth unless the user explicitly asks for exhaustive joint analysis.
- **Context Limitation** should appear only when partial context materially affects trust in the answer.
- Routine answers should not narrate context-selection mechanics.
- High-impact judgments, exhaustive review requests, and whole-document claims require a **Context Limitation** when AlfyAI used only selected context.
- **Prompt Context** must fit inside the **Context Budget**.
- **Reserved Context Budget** is allocated before document, memory, or retrieval context.
- **Core Context Budget** is for direct attachments and explicitly targeted work items.
- **Support Context Budget** is for selected evidence, summaries, and recent conversation context.
- **Awareness Context Budget** preserves breadth through **Reference Context**.
- Recent conversation turns are **Support Context** by default.
- The immediately previous exchange may receive limited protection for conversational continuity.
- Older turns should compete through relevance and budget rather than transcript recency alone.
- Large previous outputs should not become **Prompt Context** only because they are recent.
- **Generated Files** and **Generated Documents** are **Available Context** but not automatically **Prompt Context**.
- Generated-output prompt inclusion must happen through **Context Selection**, not through a separate latest-file or file-generation prompt shortcut.
- A generated output may become **Protected Context** when the user clearly continues work on it.
- A recent or visible generated output alone should usually receive no more than **Reference Context**.
- A semantically relevant generated output may receive **Excerpt Context**.
- A directly targeted generated output may receive **Task Context**.
- Old generated outputs should decay unless pinned, selected, or part of an active document family.
- When context exceeds budget, AlfyAI should downgrade **Context Inclusion Level** before dropping useful items.
- When useful items must be dropped, lower-priority **Context Signals** drop before stronger ones.
- A **Context Trace** records promoted context and the **Context Signals** that caused promotion.
- A **Context Trace** records selection facts, not private model reasoning.
- A **Context Trace** may include item identity, inclusion level, signal reasons, token estimates, trimming, limitations, and budget totals.
- A production **Context Trace** should be versioned.
- A production **Context Trace** should identify the model, context source, budget, sections, source totals, limitations, warnings, and fallbacks.
- A production **Context Trace** should include correlation identifiers such as conversation id, stream or turn id, user id, model id, provider id, model name, message id when available, attempt, and phase.
- A production **Context Trace** should not store document or message body text.
- Failing to create a **Context Trace** should not block a chat turn.
- Fallback paths should still produce a **Context Trace** when possible.
- In v1, **Context Trace** should be emitted as structured server logs.
- **Context Trace** should be compact enough for production logs.
- In v1, compact **Context Trace** should be emitted for every Normal Chat turn attempt.
- New **Context Trace** logs should replace or consolidate overlapping debug logs instead of adding parallel noise.
- Production success-path logs should be event-based and sparse.
- Routine context diagnostics should collapse into one compact **Context Trace** per turn or attempt.
- Warnings and errors should remain visible by default.
- Verbose retrieval, attachment, TEI, and per-candidate diagnostics should require an explicit debug setting.
- **Context Diagnostics Debug** controls verbose diagnostics beyond the compact **Context Trace**.
- **Context Diagnostics Debug** should be configurable at runtime with an environment default.
- Routine TEI retrieval summaries should not be always-on production logs once the system is stable.
- **Context Trace** data should not be mirrored into external memory systems.
- External memory mirrors should receive conversational content and minimal role/session metadata, not local diagnostics.
- **Context Trace** is operational diagnostics, not a normal user-interface feature.
- Normal chat UI should not surface **Context Trace**.
- Normal Chat **Context Selection** happens before the model call by default.
- If selected context is insufficient, AlfyAI should use a **Context Clarification** or **Context Limitation** rather than a hidden context-expansion loop.
- **Context Selection** should evolve through **Context Selection Slices**.
- Each **Context Selection Slice** should be testable and verifiable on its own.
- **Context Selection Slices** should follow test-driven development: prove the behavior, implement it, then refactor.
- A **Context Selection Slice** changes one observable context-selection behavior.
- A **Context Selection Slice** includes the cleanup needed for the behavior it replaces.
- A valid **Context Selection Slice** should prove behavior, trace output, and relevant regression protection.
- Broad refactors are not valid **Context Selection Slices** unless they are tied to one observable behavior.
- Every v1 **Context Selection Slice** should be a **Production Slice**.
- A **Production Slice** includes fallback behavior, observability, tests, and cleanup appropriate to its scope.
- Replacing context-selection behavior should include removing **Context Selection Debt** once the replacement path owns the behavior.

### Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "If a document is open and the user asks a general question, should the document go into the prompt?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The open document is **Available Context**, but open by itself is only a **Weak Context Signal**."
>
> **Dev:** "If the document is open and the user says 'summarize this', should it be included?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. The open document plus the user's wording creates a **Strong Context Signal**, so it can become **Prompt Context** within the **Context Budget**."
>
> **Dev:** "If the system is unsure whether the open CV matters, should it include the whole CV or omit it?"
> **Domain expert:** "Neither by default. Use **Reference Context** or **Excerpt Context** unless the user asks for a task that needs **Task Context**."
>
> **Dev:** "Should users need to understand the context-selection process?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. AlfyAI should choose automatically and ask a **Context Clarification** only when ambiguity would materially change the answer."
>
> **Dev:** "Should every answer say which excerpts were used?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Show a **Context Limitation** only when partial context materially changes how much the user should trust the answer."
>
> **Dev:** "If a turn sends too much context, should the UI show a context inspector?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Emit a structured **Context Trace** in server logs so production behavior can be verified without surfacing diagnostics to users."
>
> **Dev:** "Should each subsystem add its own prompt text?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Subsystems supply **Available Context** and **Context Signals**; **Context Selection** decides what becomes **Prompt Context**."

- A queued or running **File Production Card** keeps cancellation available as a quiet icon-only affordance rather than a text action.
- A **File Production Card** should resolve from generating to finished in place with a tight top-to-bottom reveal, not a large success flash or layout jump.

- Within the **App Typography Set**, Nimbus Sans L is the primary generated-document font; Libre Baskerville is reserved for restrained title or cover accents.
- Missing **App Typography Set** font files are a packaging error for generated-document rendering and should fail visibly rather than falling back to host fonts.
- AlfyAI owns document layout and rendering; the assistant supplies semantic content, not PDF layout code.

- A **Generated Document Family** may contain one or more **Generated Document Versions**.
- A **Working Document** may point to either a **Library Document** or a **Generated Document**.
- A **Library Document** preview in the **Document Workspace** should resolve to the original display file when that file exists.

- An **Open Documents Rail** appears only when the **Document Workspace** contains more than one **Working Document**.
- An **Open Documents Rail** lists open **Working Documents**, not unopened **Generated Document Versions**.
- On desktop, the **Open Documents Rail** should be a vertical, scrollable document switcher.
- The **Open Documents Rail** should prioritize readable titles, a clear active row, quiet file-type/provenance metadata, compact close controls, and compact generated-version badges where relevant.
- The **Open Documents Rail** should not become a secondary action toolbar, thumbnail strip, or colorful status board.
- **Generated Document Versions** remain visible through generated-document version history, separate from the **Open Documents Rail**.
- Generated-document version history should be visible only when the selected **Working Document** belongs to a multi-version **Generated Document Family**.
- Generated-document version history should stay compact in the normal **Document Workspace** view.
- Unopened **Generated Document Versions** should not show body content unless the user opens or compares that version.
- A Markdown **Working Document** should render as a readable document by default.
- A Markdown **Working Document** is a rich reading preview, not a source-style text or code preview.
- Markdown **Working Document** rendering should support common reading features such as headings, lists, tables, task lists, fenced code, callouts, and frontmatter presentation.
- Markdown **Working Document** rendering should provide document typography and visible structure for heading hierarchy, list markers, tables, blockquotes, and code fences.
- Markdown **Working Document** rendering should not resolve Obsidian-style wiki links or embeds unless AlfyAI can map them to real documents.
- Markdown **Working Document** rendering should keep safe external links clickable.
- Markdown **Working Document** rendering should not make unresolved relative links, wiki links, or embeds behave like real workspace navigation.
- A Markdown **Working Document** does not need a separate raw-text mode in the **Document Workspace**; the original file remains available through download.
- A **Document Workspace** provides read-only previews for supported document formats.
- Supported **Document Workspace** previews should preserve the natural reading shape of the format: paged PDF, readable Word/OpenDocument content, workbook tables, slide previews, rendered Markdown, rendered HTML, CSV tables, and source-style text/code previews.
- HTML **Working Document** previews should be visual, static, and sandboxed rather than fully interactive pages.
- HTML **Working Document** previews should preserve inline styling and safe same-file packaged styling when available.
- HTML **Working Document** previews should not execute scripts or allow live page navigation inside the preview.
- External network assets in HTML **Working Document** previews may remain blocked or degraded.

- An **Expanded Document Workspace** should use extra width for a better rail and preview layout, not by stretching the preview surface edge to edge.
- A docked **Document Workspace** may be horizontally resized within sensible min and max bounds.
- Double-clicking the docked **Document Workspace** resize handle should reset it to the default width.
- An **Expanded Document Workspace** should not expose manual horizontal resizing.
- **Document Workspace** implementation work should be sliced by user-verifiable behavior, not by component internals alone.
- Independently verifiable **Document Workspace** slices include open-document rail behavior, PDF interaction, Markdown rendering, Knowledge preview parity, HTML visual fidelity, resize reset, provenance placement, and expanded-width layout.
- Chat and Knowledge should use the same **Document Workspace** for inspecting **Working Documents**.
- Chat opens the **Document Workspace** docked by default so conversation remains primary.
- Knowledge may open documents in the **Expanded Document Workspace** by default.
- Knowledge opens the **Expanded Document Workspace** by default so document inspection remains primary.
- Closing the **Expanded Document Workspace** in Knowledge should return to the same Knowledge Library state underneath.
- Chat and Knowledge keep separate open **Working Document** sets even though they use the same **Document Workspace** surface.
- Opening a **Working Document** in Knowledge should not automatically add it to the Chat **Document Workspace**.
- AlfyAI should not maintain parallel document viewer surfaces with different controls or behavior for the same **Working Documents**.
- Generated-document comparison belongs inside the **Document Workspace**, not in a separate viewer surface.
- **Document Provenance** is secondary metadata for a **Working Document**, not a primary **Document Workspace** action.
- **Document Provenance** should appear near document identity details such as filename, type, and generated version.
- When **Document Provenance** points to a chat message, the **Document Workspace** may offer a quiet origin affordance that jumps to that message.
- **Document Provenance** controls should not sit beside page, slide, zoom, or pan controls.
- Document navigation and zoom controls belong with the preview inside the **Document Workspace**, not split across separate workspace and preview surfaces.
- Document navigation and zoom controls should appear only for formats that benefit from them.
- Page and slide navigation in the **Document Workspace** should start with compact controls rather than thumbnail strips.
- Page and slide navigation in the **Document Workspace** should use one compact indicator, not duplicate page or slide summaries.
- Mouse wheel input should scroll a **Working Document** preview by default; modified wheel input such as Ctrl/Cmd+wheel may zoom when the format supports zoom.
- Drag panning should activate only when a zoomable **Working Document** preview is zoomed beyond its fit/default scale.
- Image previews in the **Document Workspace** should support intuitive zoom, fit, and pan interactions for inspection.
- Image preview controls should remain read-only and should not introduce editing actions such as crop, rotate, or annotation.
- Opening a document can make it a **Working Document**, but it does not by itself make the whole body **Prompt Context**.

### Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "If the user uploads `report.pdf` twice, is the second file version 2?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. That is a **Filename Conflict**, so the second file becomes an **Auto-Renamed Upload** such as `report_1.pdf`."
>
> **Dev:** "When do we show version history?"
> **Domain expert:** "Only for a **Generated Document Family**, where each generated iteration is a **Generated Document Version**."
>
> **Dev:** "If AlfyAI creates `data.csv`, is that a **Generated Document**?"

>
> **Dev:** "Should the assistant choose between a PDF export feature and a sandbox file generator?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The user made one **File Production Request**. AlfyAI chooses the internal production path."

### Relationships

- A **Deep Research Job** is optional and explicitly started by the user.
- A **Deep Research Job** extends **Normal Chat** without replacing it.
- **Normal Chat** may use tools casually; a **Deep Research Job** is a deliberate background task.
- **Deep Research Mode** must be switched on by the user; AlfyAI does not automatically convert a **Normal Chat** request into a **Deep Research Job**.
- Successful **Deep Research Job** completion creates a **Report Boundary**.
- Cancelling a **Deep Research Job** does not create a **Report Boundary**.
- After a **Report Boundary**, users may take **Report Actions** but may not send new turns into the same conversation.
- Starting from a completed report creates a new conversation; it does not reopen the sealed conversation.
- **Discuss Report** starts a new **Normal Chat**.
- **Research Further** starts a new **Deep Research Job**.
- A **Discuss Report** conversation may still use casual tools, but it does not become a **Deep Research Job** unless the user explicitly chooses **Deep Research Mode** again.
- A sealed conversation cannot start another **Deep Research Job** directly.
- A conversation may have at most one active or uncompleted **Deep Research Job**.
- A cancelled or failed **Deep Research Job** does not prevent starting another **Deep Research Job** in the same unsealed conversation.
- Every **Deep Research Job** creates a **Research Plan** before source-heavy research begins.
- The user may approve, edit, add to, or cancel a **Research Plan**.
- Source-heavy research does not begin until the user approves the **Research Plan**.
- Cancelling before **Research Plan** approval does not create a **Report Boundary**.
- Editing a **Research Plan** produces a revised **Research Plan**; it does not start source-heavy research.
- After a **Research Plan** is revised, the user is again offered approval or further editing.
- A **Research Plan** includes a goal, key questions, source scope, depth, report shape, constraints, and deliverables.
- A **Research Plan** should include **Report Intent** before source-heavy research begins.
- **Report Intent** should be shown to the user before **Research Plan** approval so the user can correct the expected report shape.
- Source-heavy research should use the approved **Report Intent** to guide discovery, **Claim Type** selection, **Evidence Requirements**, **Coverage Assessment**, and **Report Shape Template** selection.
- Report assembly should not infer a different **Report Intent** after research has completed unless the output becomes an **Evidence Limitation Memo** because the approved intent cannot be supported.
- A **Plan Edit** is freeform; AlfyAI synthesizes the user's edit into a revised **Research Plan**.
- The Deep Research planning flow avoids exposing advanced structured controls beyond approval, cancellation, and freeform editing.
- Deep Research depth levels are **Focused Deep Research**, **Standard Deep Research**, and **Max Deep Research**.
- No Deep Research depth is selected by default; the user explicitly chooses **Focused Deep Research**, **Standard Deep Research**, or **Max Deep Research**.
- AlfyAI may recommend a different depth in the **Research Plan**, but it must not automatically change the user's selected depth.
- The knowledge library may contribute **Planning Context**.
- **Planning Context** is not automatically a **Research Source**.
- The **Research Plan** must disclose source scope before approval.
- Knowledge-library items become **Research Sources** only when the approved **Research Plan** includes them.
- Files attached to the **Deep Research Job** request may be **Research Sources** because attachment is an explicit user action.
- Current conversation context may be **Planning Context**, but is not automatically cited as a **Research Source** unless the approved **Research Plan** says the report is based on it.
- When private or workspace material influences a **Research Plan**, the plan may show a compact "context considered" disclosure.
- A "context considered" disclosure summarizes **Planning Context** by type, count, or title; it is not evidence or citation.
- Every successful **Deep Research Job** produces exactly one **Research Report**.
- A **Research Report** creates the **Report Boundary** for its conversation.
- A **Research Report** is durable and reusable; it is not only assistant message text.
- A **Research Report** includes citations and a user-facing source list.
- Every successful **Research Report** should be a **Readable Research Report**.
- A Deep Research output should be labeled a **Research Report** only when it is a **Readable Research Report**.
- A **Readable Research Report** should be produced from a **Structured Research Report** rather than a freeform Markdown blob.
- A **Structured Research Report** should be assembled through **Claim-Grounded Report Assembly**.
- A **Structured Research Report** should use a **Report Shape Template** selected by **Report Intent**, not one universal report shape with every optional section.
- Every **Report Shape Template** should include the **Report Core**.
- Intent-specific sections should be added only when they help the approved **Research Plan**: comparison reports may include matrices and entity-by-axis analysis; recommendation reports may include criteria, ranked options, fit, and risks; investigation reports may include timelines, competing explanations, and confidence; market or product scans may include shortlists, evaluation rubrics, pricing, and freshness notes; evidence limitation outputs should focus on limitation reasons, searched/reviewed scope, and recovery actions.
- Default **Report Shape Templates** should be compact and answer-first: the executive summary gives the conclusion before methodology; key findings are capped; tables appear where comparison, ranking, or scan structure helps; limitations remain visible near the conclusion and again in the source basis when needed.
- A report-writing model may improve organization, transitions, section summaries, and prose quality, but it must not introduce new cited substance outside accepted or limited **Synthesis Claims** and their verified **Claim Evidence Links**.
- A **Structured Research Report** should preserve report parts such as title, scope, executive summary, recommendation, comparison matrix, key findings, sections, limitations, and cited sources before rendering.
- A **Readable Research Report** is not a dump of every reviewed source note.
- Styling or Markdown polish cannot turn source titles, snippets, or weak per-source notes into a **Readable Research Report**.
- When the available evidence can only support weak per-source notes rather than synthesized conclusions, Deep Research should produce an **Evidence Limitation Memo** instead of a normal **Research Report**.
- A **Readable Research Report** should lead with the answer, then show the strongest evidence-backed findings, then organize the body around the approved **Research Plan**.
- Key findings in a **Readable Research Report** should be capped to a small, scannable set; additional reviewed notes belong in the **Research Workspace**, source ledger, or future appendix, not the main report body.
- A comparison-oriented **Readable Research Report** may use tables or matrices when they make differences easier to scan.
- Methodology and **Report Limitations** should be visible but compact.
- A full source ledger or activity history may be attached to the **Research Report** as metadata.
- Source review produces **Evidence Notes**; it does not produce final report conclusions.
- **Evidence Notes** should be stored as first-class persisted rows, such as a `deep_research_evidence_notes` table, rather than only inside `reviewed_note`, `extracted_claims_json`, or **Research Task** output JSON.
- An **Evidence Note** should retain durable links to the **Deep Research Job**, **Research State Checkpoint**, source or task that produced it, supported key question, and any relevant **Compared Entity** or **Comparison Axis**.
- **Evidence Notes** should preserve enough source support for later synthesis and audit, such as cited text, normalized finding text, source location when available, confidence or quality metadata, and rejection/limitation status.
- Source quality should be represented as separate **Source Quality Signals**, not as one fixed **Source Authority** tier.
- **Source Quality Signals** should include source type, independence, freshness, directness to the claim, extraction confidence, and claim fit where available.
- The same source may be strong evidence for one **Synthesis Claim** and weak evidence for another.
- A **Source Authority Summary** may help users scan the source ledger, but coverage and audit should evaluate the underlying **Source Quality Signals** in relation to specific **Evidence Notes** and **Synthesis Claims**.
- Acceptable evidence should depend on **Claim Type**.
- **Synthesis Claims** should have a **Claim Type** so coverage and audit can apply the right **Evidence Requirement**.
- **Claim Type** should be persisted for every **Synthesis Claim**.
- **Claim Type Disclosure** should be selective: reports should expose claim type labels only when they help users understand trust, freshness, source authority, or limitation.
- User-facing **Claim Type Disclosure** should use plain labels such as official specification, owner-reported pattern, dated price observation, or recommendation based on fit and limitations rather than internal enum names.
- **Evidence Requirements** should consider **Source Quality Signals**, not only whether an **Evidence Note** exists.
- **Evidence Requirements** should behave as **Claim Support Gates** for central report claims.
- If a **Claim Type** requires primary or expert evidence, weaker evidence cannot make that **Synthesis Claim** supported even when many weak sources agree.
- Weaker evidence may still appear as context, qualifying evidence, contradiction, experiential signal, or **Report Limitation** when appropriate.
- Weighted **Source Quality Signals** may rank candidate evidence, source display, or follow-up priority, but they must not override a **Claim Support Gate**.
- **Synthesis Claims** should distinguish **Central Claims** from **Non-Central Claims**.
- Unsupported **Central Claims** should block normal report publication until repaired, converted into a credible limitation state, or replaced by a supported claim.
- Unsupported **Non-Central Claims** may be removed, downgraded, or disclosed as **Report Limitations** without blocking an otherwise useful **Research Report**.
- A recommendation premise should be treated as a **Central Claim** when changing that premise would change the recommendation.
- Official specification claims should prefer official, manual, vendor, or equivalent primary evidence.
- Price or availability claims should require fresh dated evidence and should disclose timing.
- Reliability or user-experience claims may use independent reviews, forums, or owner reports when labeled as experiential evidence.
- Recommendation claims should combine use-case fit, specifications, limitations, and source diversity rather than relying on one evidence type.
- Safety, legal, medical, financial, or similarly high-stakes claims should require stronger primary or expert evidence and more explicit **Report Limitations**.
- Legacy nested source-review or task JSON does not need compatibility preservation for existing Deep Research test data.
- Once first-class **Evidence Notes** replace nested reviewer/task evidence, obsolete fields such as `reviewed_note`, `extracted_claims_json`, or task evidence JSON should be removed or stopped as write targets rather than kept as a parallel evidence path.
- **Synthesis Claims** should be stored as first-class persisted rows, such as a `deep_research_synthesis_claims` table, rather than only inside a report draft, synthesis note blob, or Markdown body.
- A **Synthesis Claim** should retain durable links to the **Deep Research Job**, **Research State Checkpoint** or synthesis pass that produced it, approved **Research Plan** question or report section, status, confidence or strength, limitation flags, and user/conversation ownership.
- **Claim Evidence Links** should explicitly connect each **Synthesis Claim** to supporting, qualifying, or contradicting **Evidence Notes**.
- Contradictory **Evidence Notes** may link to a single **Synthesis Claim** as qualifying or contradicting evidence when the claim honestly incorporates the conflict.
- A **Claim Conflict** should create **Competing Synthesis Claims** when the disagreement changes the conclusion rather than merely qualifying it.
- AlfyAI must not average away a **Claim Conflict** or hide it inside prose; it should resolve it with stronger evidence, disclose it as a **Report Limitation**, or represent it as competing claims until audit or coverage can decide.
- Citation-bearing report prose should be rendered from accepted **Synthesis Claims** and their **Claim Evidence Links**, not by asking the citation audit to infer support from text after the fact.
- A **Synthesis Claim** must answer the approved **Research Plan**, not merely restate a source title, snippet, or per-source note.
- A **Readable Research Report** is rendered from validated **Synthesis Claims**, not directly from raw source titles, snippets, or weak **Evidence Notes**.
- If Deep Research cannot produce useful **Synthesis Claims**, it should not publish a normal **Research Report**.
- A **Research Source** may be tracked as a **Discovered Source**, **Reviewed Source**, or **Cited Source**.
- Only **Reviewed Sources** may become **Cited Sources**.
- **Discovered Sources** may appear in activity history or diagnostics, but they are not evidence for report claims.
- The default **Source Ledger** should show sources that affected the research state: **Cited Sources**, topic-relevant **Reviewed Sources**, and rejected/off-topic reviewed sources when they explain limitations.
- Discovered-only sources should be collapsed or kept in diagnostics by default so users do not mistake discovery volume for used evidence.
- A **Source Ledger** should distinguish cited, reviewed topic-relevant, reviewed rejected/off-topic, and discovered-only sources when discovered-only items are shown.
- A completed **Research Report** or **Evidence Limitation Memo** should include a **Source Ledger Snapshot** so reopening the artifact shows the same source context the user saw at completion.
- The live **Claim Graph** and workspace rows remain the internal orchestration and audit truth, but the **Source Ledger Snapshot** is the stable reading surface for completed outputs.
- Cleanup, retries, or later implementation changes should not silently change the **Source Ledger Snapshot** attached to an already completed output.
- Source counts should distinguish discovered, reviewed, and cited sources instead of presenting one inflated total.
- Research Card source counts should also expose a compact **Topic-Relevant Reviewed Source** count, so users can distinguish source volume from usable evidence quality.
- A **Reviewed Source** is not automatically a **Topic-Relevant Reviewed Source**.
- A **Topic-Relevant Reviewed Source** must support the approved **Research Plan** and pass topic or named-entity relevance checks.
- Source-review model output may identify supported key questions, but deterministic topic or named-entity overlap should guard against unrelated high-authority or generic sources becoming **Topic-Relevant Reviewed Sources**.
- The **Topic-Relevance Gate** should run before a reviewed source can produce valid **Evidence Notes** for the **Claim Graph**.
- Off-topic sources may remain in the source ledger as rejected or limited workspace records, but they must not produce accepted **Evidence Notes**, satisfy **Coverage Assessment**, or support **Synthesis Claims**.
- The **Durable Research Graph Foundation** should preserve rejected/off-topic source state for transparency without allowing that state to become report-supporting evidence.
- A comparison-oriented **Research Plan** should identify **Compared Entities** and central **Comparison Axes** before source-heavy research when the user request makes them available.
- A comparison-oriented **Research Plan** should show detected **Compared Entities** and central **Comparison Axes** before approval so the user can revise scope before source-heavy research begins.
- Comparison reports should require **Topic-Relevant Reviewed Sources** across every central **Compared Entity** before the **Research Report** is eligible to complete.
- Comparison reports should require support for central **Comparison Axes** before presenting a normal comparative conclusion.
- Missing support for a **Compared Entity** or central **Comparison Axis** should create targeted discovery while **Research Budget** remains.
- Comparison-oriented discovery should use an **Entity-Axis Discovery Strategy** rather than relying only on broad goal and key-question searches.
- Discovered and reviewed comparison sources should retain enough structure to show which **Compared Entity** or **Comparison Axis** they were meant to support.
- **Coverage Assessment** for comparison reports should use the **Entity-Axis Discovery Strategy** to identify one-sided evidence, missing axes, and targeted follow-up discovery.
- If **Research Budget** is exhausted with missing entity or axis support, Deep Research should produce an **Evidence Limitation Memo** instead of padding a **Research Report** with unrelated, generic, or one-sided evidence.
- A high discovered or reviewed source count must not satisfy the **Report Eligibility Gate** when too few sources are topic-relevant.
- Source counts are progress telemetry and sanity checks; they are not the main proof of report readiness.
- **Coverage Assessment** should operate primarily over **Evidence Notes**, **Synthesis Claims**, **Claim Evidence Links**, and **Claim Readiness**.
- **Coverage Assessment** should consider **Source Quality Signals** when deciding whether evidence is strong enough for claim-ready coverage.
- **Coverage Assessment** should evaluate whether each central **Synthesis Claim** meets the **Evidence Requirement** for its **Claim Type**.
- Central **Synthesis Claims** that fail their **Claim Support Gate** should create **Coverage Gaps**, **Repair Passes**, rejected claims, or **Report Limitations** rather than publishable support.
- **Coverage Assessment** may allow a **Research Report** to publish after unsupported **Non-Central Claims** are removed, downgraded, or converted into **Report Limitations**.
- Reviewed-source counts and supported-key-question arrays may help detect weak coverage, but they should not by themselves prove that a **Research Report** is publishable.
- **Report Eligibility Gate** should require enough topic-relevant evidence and enough claim-ready coverage for the approved **Research Plan** before normal report publication.
- Deep Research depth sets a **Research Budget**.
- A **Research Budget** is a ceiling, not a promised source count.
- Deep Research depth sets a **Research Concurrency Budget**.
- **Source Processing Concurrency** and **Model Reasoning Concurrency** are separate budgets.
- **Source Processing Concurrency** may be wider than **Model Reasoning Concurrency** because fetching and extraction are less semantically risky than LLM review, synthesis, audit, or repair.
- Initial configurable concurrency defaults should be: **Focused Deep Research** uses up to 6 source-processing slots and 2 model-reasoning slots; **Standard Deep Research** uses up to 12 source-processing slots and 4 model-reasoning slots; **Max Deep Research** uses up to 24 source-processing slots and 8 model-reasoning slots.
- Synthesis, coverage assessment, citation audit, report assembly, and repair decisions should remain low-concurrency coordination steps even when source review runs in parallel.
- **Research Concurrency Budget** should be enforced per job, per user, and globally so deeper research does not overwhelm provider, browser, database, or worker capacity.
- Deep Research depth sets a **Pass Budget**.
- A **Pass Budget** is a maximum, not a required number of passes.
- Deep Research depth sets a **Repair Pass Budget**.
- Initial configurable depth ceilings should be: **Focused Deep Research** reviews up to 24 sources, runs 2-3 **Meaningful Research Passes**, and allows 1 **Repair Pass**; **Standard Deep Research** reviews up to 75 sources, runs 3-5 **Meaningful Research Passes**, and allows 2 **Repair Passes**; **Max Deep Research** reviews up to 200 sources, runs 5-8 **Meaningful Research Passes**, and allows 3 **Repair Passes**.
- Depth ceilings should remain runtime-configurable policy defaults, not permanent hardcoded limits.
- Deep Research depth also sets a **Minimum Pass Expectation**.
- A **Minimum Pass Expectation** prevents any Deep Research depth from publishing after only a light search pass.
- **Minimum Pass Expectation** should be implemented as a configurable **Depth Pass Floor** rather than a permanently hardcoded constant.
- Initial **Depth Pass Floor** defaults should be 2 **Meaningful Research Passes** for **Focused Deep Research**, 3 for **Standard Deep Research**, and 5 for **Max Deep Research**.
- Only **Meaningful Research Passes** should count toward a **Minimum Pass Expectation**.
- A pass counts as a **Meaningful Research Pass** when it reviews new topic-relevant evidence, resolves or updates **Coverage Gaps**, creates or repairs **Synthesis Claims**, resolves **Claim Conflicts**, or performs audit-driven repair.
- A **Repair Pass** counts toward the **Depth Pass Floor** only when it is a **Meaningful Research Pass**.
- A **Repair Pass** that resolves a **Claim Conflict**, finds replacement evidence, closes a **Coverage Gap**, or converts an unsupported **Central Claim** into a clear **Report Limitation** may count toward the **Depth Pass Floor**.
- A **Repair Pass** that only reformats, retries an API call, or reruns audit without new graph state must not count toward the **Depth Pass Floor**.
- No-op passes, transient retry attempts, and formatting-only work must not satisfy a **Minimum Pass Expectation**.
- Deep Research depth also sets a **Publishable Evidence Floor** for normal **Research Report** completion.
- A **Publishable Evidence Floor** is separate from a **Research Budget**: the budget limits how much work may be attempted, while the floor decides whether the result is good enough to publish as a **Research Report**.
- Changes to **Research Budget** or **Pass Budget** ceilings should be independently verifiable from changes to **Publishable Evidence Floor** and **Minimum Pass Expectation** enforcement.
- **Focused Deep Research** may publish a concise cited brief when it meets a narrow but coherent **Publishable Evidence Floor**.
- **Focused Deep Research** is still Deep Research; if the user only wants a few quick searches, **Normal Chat** with web search is the better path.
- **Focused Deep Research** must satisfy its own **Minimum Pass Expectation** before publishing a normal **Research Report**.
- **Standard Deep Research** should normally require at least one follow-up or coverage-driven **Iterative Research Pass** for multi-question reports.
- **Standard Deep Research** should require multi-source synthesis across the central **Research Plan** questions before publishing a **Research Report**.
- **Max Deep Research** should expect multiple **Iterative Research Passes**, including conflict and gap resolution where needed, before publishing a **Research Report**.
- **Max Deep Research** should require broad coverage across central **Compared Entities**, **Comparison Axes**, conflicts, limitations, and source diversity before publishing a **Research Report**.
- A **Research Plan** should show a **Research Effort Estimate** before approval.
- A **Research Effort Estimate** is coarse and not a promise.
- A **Deep Research Job** may stop before reaching its maximum **Research Budget** or **Pass Budget** only after satisfying the selected depth's **Minimum Pass Expectation**, or when it must end as an **Evidence Limitation Memo**, failure, or cancellation.
- A **Deep Research Job** must not pad weak sources to satisfy a **Research Budget**.
- A **Deep Research Job** must continue research when it is below the selected **Depth Pass Floor**, still has budget, and still has plausible source or evidence paths.
- A **Deep Research Job** should continue research when central **Coverage Gaps**, unresolved **Claim Conflicts**, or unsupported **Central Claims** remain and budget is available.
- A **Deep Research Job** should run a **Repair Pass** when **Citation Audit** or **Coverage Assessment** finds repairable central support problems and **Repair Pass Budget** remains.
- A **Deep Research Job** should publish a normal **Research Report** only after the selected **Depth Pass Floor**, **Publishable Evidence Floor**, **Report Eligibility Gate**, **Citation Audit**, and **Structured Research Report** validation all pass.
- A **Deep Research Job** should publish an **Evidence Limitation Memo** when the approved goal cannot be supported credibly after budget exhaustion, source-pool exhaustion, unrepaired central gaps, or unresolvable claim conflicts.
- A **Deep Research Job** should fail only for true execution failure, unrecoverable infrastructure failure, invalid durable state, or user cancellation; weak evidence should normally become an **Evidence Limitation Memo**.
- Clarifying questions are allowed before **Research Plan** approval.
- After **Research Plan** approval, a **Deep Research Job** should run to completion without blocking for more user input.
- If ambiguity appears after approval, the **Deep Research Job** should make and disclose a reasonable assumption instead of pausing indefinitely.
- While a **Deep Research Job** is running, the user may view progress or cancel it.
- A **Research Plan** cannot be edited after approval in v1.
- To change direction after approval, the user cancels and starts a new **Deep Research Job**.
- A running **Deep Research Job** shows an **Activity Timeline** rather than only a spinner.
- The **Activity Timeline** is persisted and remains attached to the **Research Report** after completion.
- The **Activity Timeline** shows user-facing stage progress, source counts, brief summaries, assumptions, and warnings.
- The **Activity Timeline** body should show **Meaningful Timeline Events**, not every pending or routine workflow stage as a separate row.
- **Meaningful Timeline Events** include the current stage summary, changed source counts, warnings, completion or failure outcomes, coverage decisions, and compact audit results.
- Pending stages should be represented through the **Stage Progress Ring** or compact stage indicator rather than rendered as full timeline rows.
- Routine completed stages may collapse into compact progress state rather than occupying black or filled rows.
- The **Activity Timeline** should avoid repeating source counts on every step when the same counts are already visible in the Research Card summary.
- Per-event source counts may appear only when they add meaningful change or diagnostic value.
- A **Stage Progress Ring** may map workflow stages to approximate visual progress, but it should not present exact percentage language while the job is still running.
- A **Stage Progress Ring** should represent coarse workflow stage progress, not detailed pass counts, gap counts, and audit state all at once.
- The visible progress label should name the active stage or completion state, such as reviewing sources, auditing citations, writing report, or complete.
- A running **Stage Progress Ring** is an orientation aid, not a guarantee of remaining runtime or work.
- A **Stage Progress Ring** or compact stage indicator may support **Stage Detail Reveal**.
- A **Stage Detail Reveal** should show only **Meaningful Timeline Events**, **Meaningful Pass Progress**, changed counts, warnings, or compact audit results for the selected stage.
- **Meaningful Pass Progress** may show details such as pass count against **Depth Pass Floor**, open **Coverage Gaps**, resolved **Claim Conflicts**, or audit-driven repair state.
- The compact **Research Card** header should stay stage-oriented and avoid mechanical pass-floor phrasing.
- **Stage Detail Reveal** may show explicit pass-floor wording, such as "Pass 2 of 3 minimum", when it helps the user understand progress.
- Stages without meaningful details should remain compact and should not invent filler text.
- Newly appearing progress states and **Meaningful Timeline Events** should use **Progress Reveal Motion** so updates feel smooth and effortless without adding visual clutter.
- The **Activity Timeline** does not expose private model reasoning or chain-of-thought.
- Deep Research user-facing text must support English and Hungarian.
- **Research Language** defaults to the latest user request language unless the user explicitly asks for another output language.
- **Research Sources** may be in languages other than the **Research Language**.
- Source titles, quotes, and citations may remain in their original source language.
- Deep Research prose should not mix English and Hungarian except for source material, product names, file names, URLs, citations, and quotes.
- A **Research Card** presents the **Research Plan**, running **Activity Timeline**, source progress, completion state, and **Report Actions** inside chat.
- A **Research Card** should derive a **Research Card Severity** separately from the operational **Deep Research Job** status.
- Operational job status describes execution state, such as awaiting approval, running, completed, failed, or cancelled.
- **Research Card Severity** describes user-facing meaning, such as working, needs attention, insufficient evidence, completed, cancelled, or failed.
- Awaiting approval or plan edit should map to needs attention.
- Running normally should map to working.
- A completed **Research Report** should map to completed.
- An **Evidence Limitation Memo** should map to insufficient evidence.
- User cancellation should map to cancelled.
- Infrastructure failure or unrecoverable execution failure should map to failed.
- A **Research Card** should use cited-site favicons for **Cited Sources** where available, as visual source identity rather than evidence authority.
- When a **Deep Research Job** produces an **Evidence Limitation Memo**, the **Research Card** should present it as an insufficient-evidence research outcome, not as a failed job or system error.
- A memo-state **Research Card** should show grounded reason summaries from **Report Limitations**, useful source/evidence counts, and **Memo Recovery Actions**.
- **Memo Recovery Actions** should be structured actions, not only prose suggestions.
- **Memo Recovery Actions** should be derived from grounded limitation origin data where possible, so the UI can offer relevant actions such as revise the compared entities, add missing sources, choose deeper depth, or start targeted follow-up research.
- Choosing a **Memo Recovery Action** must not silently publish a **Research Report** or auto-upgrade depth; the user remains in control of the revised plan or new **Deep Research Job**.
- Failed-job styling and language should be reserved for cancellation, infrastructure failure, unrecoverable worker failure, or other true execution failures.
- A **Research Card** is not the full **Research Report**.
- After a **Report Boundary**, the **Research Card** remains visible in the read-only conversation.
- The full **Research Report** opens in the workspace/report viewing surface rather than inline as chat content.
- The **Research Report** view exposes the report body, source list, and **Activity Timeline**.
- A **Research Report** is a durable workspace document.
- A **Research Report** is not automatically persona memory.
- A **Research Report** should influence future conversations only through explicit or strongly relevant retrieval signals.
- A **Deep Research Job** uses a **Research Workspace** for predictable, inspectable working state.
- A **Research Workspace** is structured; it is not a generic agent filesystem.
- AlfyAI should follow a Kimi-inspired Deep Research pattern where practical: iterative search, source review, reasoning over gaps, and synthesis happen as structured passes rather than one broad search followed by Markdown generation.
- The **Research Orchestrator** owns the **Research Workspace** and decides when to assign **Research Tasks**, run **Coverage Assessment**, request targeted follow-up, synthesize, or stop.
- The report writer does not own end-to-end research quality; it renders and shapes report-ready material after orchestration, coverage, synthesis, and audit have produced enough structured evidence.
- Each **Iterative Research Pass** should record its search intent, reviewed-source outcomes, **Evidence Notes**, **Coverage Gaps**, and pass decision in the **Research Workspace**.
- Kimi-inspired behavior must remain inspectable through AlfyAI's **Research Workspace** and **Activity Timeline**; it should not become an opaque transcript or private chain-of-thought surface.
- AlfyAI's Kimi-inspired foundation should match the practical pattern of long-horizon multi-turn search, tool use, context management, iterative cross-validation, conflict correction, and resumable work.
- AlfyAI should not try to imitate Kimi's end-to-end reinforcement-learning training in v1; the product foundation is a deterministic, durable **Research Orchestrator** plus structured graph state that can later benefit from stronger models.
- AlfyAI's equivalent of long-context management is **Workspace Rehydration** from durable graph state, not trusting one growing prompt transcript.
- AlfyAI's equivalent of partial rollout is a resumable **Research Resume Point** at pass and task boundaries.
- AlfyAI's equivalent of conflict self-correction is explicit **Claim Conflicts**, **Competing Synthesis Claims**, **Coverage Gaps**, **Repair Passes**, and **Citation Audit Verdicts**.
- The durable database-backed **Research Workspace** is the source of truth for iterative research state; model context and worker memory are disposable.
- The first implementation milestone should be the **Durable Research Graph Foundation**, not visual report rendering.
- The **Durable Research Graph Foundation** should include persisted pass checkpoints, first-class **Coverage Gaps**, first-class **Evidence Notes**, first-class **Synthesis Claims**, **Claim Evidence Links**, **Citation Audit Verdicts**, and **Report Limitations**.
- The **Topic-Relevance Gate** should be implemented before the **Durable Research Graph Foundation** starts treating reviewed sources as valid evidence.
- Report renderer work, Markdown polish, higher depth budgets, and richer progress UI should build on the **Durable Research Graph Foundation** instead of trying to compensate for missing research state.
- Each **Iterative Research Pass** must create or update a **Research State Checkpoint** before the next pass, synthesis, memo publication, or report publication begins.
- **Research State Checkpoints** should be stored as first-class persisted pass records, such as a `deep_research_passes` table, rather than inferred from **Research Tasks**, **Reviewed Sources**, or **Activity Timeline** rows.
- A **Research State Checkpoint** should include the pass number, search intent, task status summary, reviewed-source references, **Evidence Note** references, **Coverage Assessment** result, **Coverage Gaps**, limitations, usage summary, and next decision.
- A **Research State Checkpoint** may be mutable while its **Iterative Research Pass** is running.
- Once a **Research State Checkpoint** records a terminal **Pass Decision**, that decision should be treated as immutable.
- Later corrections, repairs, or reversals should create a new **Iterative Research Pass** or **Repair Pass** rather than mutating a completed pass decision.
- A **Repair Pass** uses the same workspace, checkpoint, coverage-gap, evidence-note, synthesis-claim, and audit-verdict model as other **Iterative Research Passes**.
- **Citation Audit** may request a **Repair Pass**, but it should not hide new research, replacement claims, or limitation decisions inside citation-audit side effects.
- **Coverage Gaps** should be stored as first-class persisted rows, such as a `deep_research_coverage_gaps` table, rather than only inside pass checkpoint JSON or final report limitations.
- A **Coverage Gap** should retain durable links to the **Deep Research Job**, **Research State Checkpoint**, approved plan question or comparison axis, status, severity, recommended next action, and any **Evidence Notes**, **Synthesis Claims**, or **Report Limitations** that resolved or inherited it.
- **Coverage Gaps** should have lifecycle states such as open, targeted, resolved, superseded, exhausted, or converted to limitation.
- A resolved **Coverage Gap** should remain inspectable so AlfyAI can explain why a targeted follow-up pass happened and which evidence or claims closed it.
- **Research Tasks**, **Reviewed Sources**, **Activity Timeline** events, usage records, and future synthesis records should reference the relevant **Research State Checkpoint** where practical.
- **Workspace Rehydration** should happen at the start of every worker step and before any model call that depends on prior research state.
- A **Research Resume Point** should exist for every running pass, required **Research Task**, synthesis step, citation-audit step, repair step, and report-assembly step.
- A **Research Resume Point** should record enough state to continue without relying on process memory, private model thoughts, or a previous worker's prompt context.
- Pass transitions should be idempotent: retrying a worker step after a crash must not duplicate sources, tasks, coverage gaps, or timeline events for the same pass decision.
- Pass completion and next-step creation should be committed atomically where practical, so a crash cannot leave the UI showing progress that the orchestrator cannot resume from.
- A timed-out or crashed job should resume from the latest valid **Research Resume Point** and rehydrate the **Research Workspace** before doing new work.
- If the latest pass has no terminal **Pass Decision**, resume should either complete the pending required tasks, mark expired tasks retryable or failed, or create a new recovery pass without mutating completed pass decisions.
- **Research Usage** is tracked for internal Deep Research model calls, tool calls, and workflow stages.
- **Research Usage** belongs to the **Deep Research Job** or **Research Task** that produced it, not fake chat messages.
- Deep Research cost should roll up into user, conversation, model, provider, and billing-month analytics.
- **Runtime Policy** should be runtime-configurable through the same admin/config path as other model-facing operational policy.
- **Runtime Policy** should include depth budgets, concurrency budgets, per-user active-job limits, global active-job limits, timeout windows, retry limits, and overrun behavior.
- Initial active-job defaults should allow one running **Deep Research Job** per conversation, up to two running jobs per user, and a conservative global worker cap sized to deployed infrastructure.
- When runtime is exhausted at a safe boundary, the orchestrator should run **Coverage Assessment** and choose report, memo, or failure from durable state instead of silently abandoning the job.
- User cancellation should stop new work, mark running tasks cancelled where practical, preserve the **Research Workspace**, and show cancelled **Research Card Severity** rather than an evidence memo.
- User-facing **Research Usage** may show runtime, source counts, and actual or estimated cost after completion.
- The primary completed-job time shown in the **Research Card** should be **Final Research Time**.
- **Final Research Time** should sit near the completed-job cost summary so users can scan both effort and cost.
- Worker-active time, model latency, token usage, and provider details may remain in analytics or diagnostics rather than the compact **Research Card**.
- Internal token/model/provider details belong in analytics, not the main **Research Report** UI.
- Deep Research uses **Iterative Research Passes**.
- A **Coverage Assessment** happens after each **Iterative Research Pass**.
- A **Coverage Assessment** may trigger another **Iterative Research Pass** when coverage is insufficient and **Research Budget** remains.
- A **Coverage Assessment** considers key-question coverage, source quality, source diversity, conflicts, freshness, and remaining **Research Budget**.
- **Coverage Assessment** is a separate structured evaluator step rather than the report writer's implicit judgment.
- **Coverage Assessment** returns whether coverage is sufficient and any **Coverage Gaps**.
- When coverage is insufficient and **Research Budget** remains, **Coverage Gaps** guide targeted discovery.
- If **Research Budget** is exhausted before coverage is strong, the **Research Report** must disclose limitations.
- **Coverage Assessment** decisions should be summarized in the **Activity Timeline**.
- **Research Tasks** may run in parallel, but each task has a narrow assignment.
- **Research Tasks** write structured outputs into the **Research Workspace**.
- The orchestrator decides whether to continue discovery, synthesize, or complete; individual **Research Tasks** do not.
- A **Pass Barrier** prevents **Coverage Assessment** or synthesis from running on incomplete required work.
- Parallelism is bounded by depth, user, and system limits.
- A failed **Research Task** records its reason in the **Research Workspace**.
- Transient **Research Task** failures may be retried.
- Failed **Research Tasks** become **Coverage Gaps** when they affect critical questions and cannot be replaced within budget.
- A **Deep Research Job** does not fail only because some non-critical **Research Tasks** fail.
- A **Deep Research Job** may complete with **Report Limitations** when it can still produce a useful, citation-supported **Research Report**.
- A **Deep Research Job** should fail only when no credible **Research Report** can be produced, core claims cannot be supported, required source pools are inaccessible, infrastructure repeatedly fails, or cancellation is requested.
- **Report Limitations** must be visible in the **Research Report** rather than hidden in internal logs.
- Every **Research Report** goes through **Citation Audit**.
- **Citation Audit** verifies the **Claim Graph**, not only citation formatting.
- **Citation Audit** should inspect **Synthesis Claims**, **Evidence Notes**, and **Claim Evidence Links** before user-facing Markdown citation cleanup.
- **Citation Audit** should produce first-class **Citation Audit Verdicts** for **Synthesis Claims**, such as supported, partially supported, unsupported, contradicted, or needs repair.
- **Citation Audit Verdicts** should be durable inputs to **Report Limitations**, memo generation, and final report rendering.
- Markdown citation cleanup is a rendering concern after claim-graph verification, not the primary purpose of **Citation Audit**.
- Unsupported core claims must be repaired, removed, or disclosed as **Report Limitations**.
- **Report Limitations** should be generated from explicit **Coverage Gaps**, rejected or limited **Synthesis Claims**, unresolved contradictions, and **Citation Audit** verdicts rather than freeform caveats added after report writing.
- Each **Report Limitation** should retain enough structured origin data to show what question, entity, axis, claim, source pool, or audit verdict caused it.
- **Report Limitations** should be first-class graph objects, not derived-only fields on the final Markdown report.
- Generic limitations may be included only when they are tied to a concrete workspace signal, such as unavailable source types, stale evidence, inaccessible sources, or exhausted **Research Budget**.
- **Citation Audit** may trigger one **Repair Pass** before completion or failure.
- Every **Research Report** must pass the **Report Eligibility Gate** before **Citation Audit** can publish it.
- **Citation Audit** verifies evidence support for retained claims through **Claim Evidence Links**; it does not replace the **Report Eligibility Gate**.
- **Citation Audit** produces an **Audited Structured Report**, not a flat retained-claims list.
- **Citation Audit** should preserve report sections, comparison tables, recommendations, and plan-shaped analysis when their claims remain supported.
- **Claim-Grounded Report Assembly** should retain claim IDs and evidence-link references inside report sections, key findings, recommendations, comparison rows, and limitation records until final rendering.
- A **Research Report** has a semi-fixed readable structure: short title, executive summary, capped key findings, compact methodology, main body organized by the **Research Plan**, source list, and **Report Limitations** when applicable.
- A **Research Report** may add plan-specific sections such as recommendations, comparison matrices, timelines, methodology, appendices, or next steps.
- **Citation Audit** should preserve readable report structure while removing unsupported claims; it should not replace every report section with the same retained-claim list.
- Markdown is a rendering target for a **Structured Research Report**, not the report's source of truth.
- If the **Report Eligibility Gate** fails because too few sources are topic-relevant, Deep Research should end with an insufficient-relevant-evidence outcome instead of publishing a normal **Research Report**.
- An insufficient-relevant-evidence outcome may create an **Evidence Limitation Memo**.
- An **Evidence Limitation Memo** is durable and inspectable, but it must not create the same user expectation as a completed **Research Report**.
- An **Evidence Limitation Memo** should use the same grounded **Report Limitations** and **Research Workspace** state as a failed-to-publish **Research Report**, rather than a separate memo-only explanation path.
- An **Evidence Limitation Memo** should summarize the approved goal, searched/reviewed scope, topic-relevant counts, evidence-note or claim-readiness gaps when available, rejected or limited claims, audit outcomes when available, why no credible report was produced, and the best next research direction.
- When the limitation state is the useful output, the **Evidence Limitation Memo** is that limitation state rendered for the user.
- An **Evidence Limitation Memo** does not create a **Report Boundary**.
- After an **Evidence Limitation Memo**, the conversation should remain usable so the user can use **Memo Recovery Actions** such as revising the request, adding sources, choosing deeper depth, or starting another **Deep Research Job**.
- Deep Research should be built in independently testable and verifiable vertical slices.
- Deep Research slices should follow test-driven development: prove the behavior, implement it, then refactor.
- Deep Research v1 slices should be production-capable rather than prototype-only.
- A production-capable Deep Research slice includes fallback behavior, observability, tests, and cleanup appropriate to its scope.
- Deep Research cleanup should be part of replacement slices so obsolete paths do not remain as parallel behavior.
- A **Deep Research Evaluation Harness** should exist before raising Deep Research depth budgets.
- The **Deep Research Evaluation Harness** should include **Golden Research Fixtures** for off-topic high-authority sources, enough sources but weak **Evidence Notes**, unsupported **Central Claims**, **Non-Central Claim** removal, **Claim Conflicts**, crash/resume across passes, Hungarian output, and the bad downloaded report regression.
- The **Deep Research Evaluation Harness** should include Kimi-inspired hard-search fixtures that require multi-turn search, cross-validation, conflict correction, and cautious verification before answering.
- A generated output should fail evaluation when it reads like a source-note dump, repeats snippets without synthesis, makes unsupported central claims, hides unresolved conflicts, cites sources that do not support the claim, or publishes a report when the correct outcome is an **Evidence Limitation Memo**.
- Evaluation should treat readable synthesis, claim grounding, source relevance, citation support, durable resume, and localization as separate acceptance dimensions.
- CI and normal automated verification should use deterministic **Golden Research Fixtures**, not live web search.
- **Live Research Evaluation** may exist for manual or scheduled review, but it should be optional, non-blocking, and should save outputs for inspection rather than acting as a deterministic pass/fail gate.
- Raising **Research Budget** or **Pass Budget** without the **Deep Research Evaluation Harness** risks making low-quality research slower and more expensive rather than better.

### Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "Should every report request become a **Deep Research Job**?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Normal Chat** can still answer, search, and generate files. A **Deep Research Job** only starts when the user explicitly switches it on."
>
> **Dev:** "If the user cancels research midway, is that conversation now read-only?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Only successful completion creates a **Report Boundary**."
>
> **Dev:** "Can the user ask a follow-up in the same conversation after the report is done?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. They can start a new conversation from the report, or start another **Deep Research Job**, but the completed report conversation stays read-only."
>
> **Dev:** "Should asking about a completed report automatically start deeper research?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Discuss Report** starts **Normal Chat**. **Research Further** is the explicit deep research path."
>
> **Dev:** "Can a deep research request immediately start browsing because the prompt seems clear?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It first creates a **Research Plan** that the user can edit or approve."
>
> **Dev:** "If the user edits the plan, does that count as starting research?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Editing produces a revised **Research Plan** and asks again whether to approve or edit."
>
> **Dev:** "Should users edit plans through a complex form?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. A **Plan Edit** is freeform, and AlfyAI turns it into a revised **Research Plan**."
>
> **Dev:** "Can AlfyAI silently upgrade a focused task to max depth?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It can recommend a depth change in the **Research Plan**, but the user decides."
>
> **Dev:** "Can private library material help AlfyAI understand what the user likely means?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes, as **Planning Context**. It only becomes a **Research Source** if the approved **Research Plan** includes it."
>
> **Dev:** "Should the user see why the plan seems personalized?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes, the plan can show a compact context-considered disclosure without turning that context into report evidence."
>
> **Dev:** "Is the final deep research output just another assistant message?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It is a durable **Research Report** that can be opened, reused, and inspected."
>
> **Dev:** "Can we say Max used 600 sources if most were only search candidates?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Say 600 **Discovered Sources**, then separately count **Reviewed Sources** and **Cited Sources**."
>
> **Dev:** "Did Max fail if it reviewed fewer than 100 sources for a narrow topic?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The **Research Budget** is a ceiling, not a quota."
>
> **Dev:** "Can approved research stop midway to ask the user what they meant?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. After approval, it should continue and disclose any assumptions it had to make."
>
> **Dev:** "Can the user add 'exclude Reddit' after approved research is already running?"
> **Domain expert:** "Not in v1. They can cancel and start a new **Deep Research Job** with a revised **Research Plan**."
>
> **Dev:** "Should running research just show a spinner?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It should show a persisted **Activity Timeline** with meaningful research stages and source progress."
>
> **Dev:** "If the user asks in Hungarian for research using English sources, what language is the report?"
> **Domain expert:** "The **Research Language** is Hungarian, while **Research Sources** may remain English."
>
> **Dev:** "Should the completed report render inline as a huge chat message?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The **Research Card** stays compact, and the full **Research Report** opens separately."
>
> **Dev:** "Where should users inspect a long Max report and its sources?"
> **Domain expert:** "In the workspace/report viewing surface, not by scrolling through chat."
>
> **Dev:** "Does completing a sensitive report mean future casual chats should remember it automatically?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. A **Research Report** is a workspace document, not automatic persona memory."
>
> **Dev:** "Should deep research rely on a hidden agent filesystem?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It should use a structured **Research Workspace** so progress, sources, notes, and citations are inspectable."

> **Dev:** "Should AlfyAI copy Kimi's deep research pattern where it can?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. Follow the useful part: iterative search, review, gap reasoning, and synthesis as structured **Iterative Research Passes** owned by the **Research Orchestrator**."
>
> **Dev:** "Should the report writer own end-to-end research quality?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The report writer renders report-ready material after orchestration, coverage, synthesis, and audit have produced enough structured evidence."
>
> **Dev:** "Does deep research search once and then write?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It runs **Iterative Research Passes** until **Coverage Assessment** says coverage is sufficient or the **Research Budget** is exhausted."
>
> **Dev:** "If the report writer wants to proceed but a key question lacks evidence, what happens?"
> **Domain expert:** "A separate **Coverage Assessment** identifies the **Coverage Gap** and drives another targeted discovery pass if budget remains."
>
> **Dev:** "Can parallel search workers synthesize as soon as they individually finish?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Research Tasks** write to the **Research Workspace**, and a **Pass Barrier** waits for required tasks before assessment or synthesis."
>
> **Dev:** "Should Max fail because three reviewed pages could not be fetched?"
> **Domain expert:** "No, unless those failures prevent a credible report and cannot be replaced or disclosed as **Coverage Gaps**."
>
> **Dev:** "If two vendors hide pricing behind sales forms, should the whole report fail?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Complete with **Report Limitations** and avoid unsupported pricing claims."
>
> **Dev:** "Can the report claim SOC 2 certification from a vague security marketing page?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. **Citation Audit** must reject or repair unsupported claims."
>
> **Dev:** "Should every report use exactly the same section template?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The structure is semi-fixed: core trust sections are always present, while plan-specific sections adapt."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "canonical" means the preferred term inside the Deep Research subdomain, not the default format for all AlfyAI answers or reports.
- "finished chat" means a conversation after a **Report Boundary**, not cancellation, deletion, or archival.
