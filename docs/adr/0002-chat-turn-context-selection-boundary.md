# Chat turns own context selection

Normal Chat context selection will be owned by a dedicated chat-turn service rather than by Honcho, task-state, knowledge retrieval, or Langflow transport code. Those subsystems may supply available context and context signals, but the chat-turn context-selection boundary decides what becomes prompt context, at what inclusion level, and within what budget, so passive workspace state, memory, attachments, and retrieved evidence cannot independently stack into oversized prompts.

The central model-scaled context budget planner belongs inside the chat-turn boundary. Knowledge, task-state, Honcho, and retrieval services may expose candidates, signals, source metadata, snippets, or estimates, but they should not own final prompt-budget policy.

Web research evidence should eventually use the same prompt-budget policy rather than maintaining a separate small-context selection system. The migration may be sliced separately because web research has source-opening, citation, quote-quality, and audit constraints, but the long-term product behavior should not diverge into two context systems.

For web research, the web-research service owns source discovery, page opening, quote extraction, citation quality, and audit diagnostics. The shared context-selection policy should govern final evidence inclusion and sizing before content is sent to the answer-writing model.

**Considered Options**

- Keep context assembly distributed across Honcho, task-state, knowledge, and Langflow.
- Make Honcho the central prompt-context assembler.
- Create a dedicated chat-turn context-selection boundary.

We chose the chat-turn boundary because context selection is per-turn Normal Chat behavior, while Honcho remains an integration adapter and knowledge/task services remain candidate suppliers rather than generic prompt engines.
