The comparison needs sharper ranking and adoption criteria.",

The accepted evidence supports measuring these factors together, but this section only summarizes the criteria and does not yet translate them into a validation plan. It also omits the reviewer workflow for failed retrieval and the evidence owner for weak answers.",

The draft says reranking adds cost, yet it does not quantify tradeoffs or describe how to decide whether the added step is justified. It also omits a budget rule for reranking depth before teams commit to production service limits.",

			"Production rollout needs observability, source logging, access controls, and clear failure handling so reviewers can inspect why evidence was selected. These concerns are named here, but the draft still lacks concrete sequencing for rollout, monitoring, and escalation when retrieved evidence conflicts. It also needs clearer ownership between platform and compliance teams during pilot review and after launch.",
			"",
			"## Recommendation",
			"We recommend starting with hybrid retrieval plus reranking and validating it against the team's own corpus before wider rollout. That recommendation is directionally useful, but it remains too compact to explain the operational threshold for moving from pilot to production.",
			"",
			"## Tradeoffs",
			"Vector-only retrieval is simpler to reason about at the application layer, while keyword retrieval keeps precise compliance terms visible. Hybrid retrieval combines those strengths, but the draft only sketches the comparison and leaves unclear which tradeoffs matter most for regulated SaaS.",
			"",

			"The accepted sources do not provide identical measurements for the same corpus, latency budget, and governance requirements. This limits confidence, especially when comparing benchmark behavior with production behavior under access controls and reviewer workflows.",

The practical decision is to keep retrieval broad at first, then use reranking and source-level logging to make final evidence selection reviewable.",

Second, keep vector-only retrieval as a fallback for exploratory discovery where exact policy language is less important.

This ranking gives the team a default architecture and a clear reason to reject simpler but weaker alternatives.",

Measure recall@10, reranker precision, citation coverage, p95 latency, and reviewer acceptance on representative policy, support, and product documents. Keep query logs, selected source IDs, reranker scores, and rejected-source samples so compliance reviewers can inspect both what the assistant used and what it ignored.",
