# Server Services — Internal Map

Parent: [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) lists every service file and its role. This file covers **cross-service dependencies, complexity ordering, and data flow** — what the parent doesn't document.

## Complexity Hotspots (by line count)

| Rank | File | Lines | Why large |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | `task-state.ts` | 1,535 | Facade + task routing, evidence selection, checkpointing, steering |
| 2 | `honcho.ts` | 1,460 | Honcho client lifecycle, session bootstrap, context construction |
| 3 | `stream-orchestrator.ts` | 1,018 | Full chat-turn streaming pipeline, upstream retry, downstream SSE framing |
| 4 | `chat-turn/stream.ts` | 520 | Re-exports sub-modules; retains internal chunk runtime, preserve handling, and utility helpers |
| 5 | `knowledge/store/attachments.ts` | 583 | Upload dedupe, readiness checks, artifact linking |
| 6 | `task-state/continuity.ts` | 683 | Project memory, focus continuity, task-project linking |
| 7 | `knowledge/context.ts` | 432 | Working-set ranking, context status, compaction logic |
| 8 | `knowledge/capsules.ts` | 347 | Workflow summarization, generated-output artifacts |
| 9 | `knowledge/store/core.ts` | 353 | Artifact CRUD, mapping, token-budget constants |
| 10 | `task-state/artifacts.ts` | 358 | Chunking, prompt-snippet selection, historical summarization |
| 11 | `knowledge/store/cleanup.ts` | 302 | Cross-reference-aware deletion, bulk cleanup |
| 12 | `chat-turn/retry-cleanup.ts` | ~190 | Idempotent cleanup of failed turn data (evidence, checkpoints, work capsules, generated outputs) |

**Chat-turn sub-modules** (extracted from stream.ts):
- `chat-turn/stream-parser.ts` — async generator for parsing Langflow SSE/JSON event streams
- `chat-turn/thinking-normalizer.ts` — thinking block/tag stripping and reasoning content extraction
- `chat-turn/tool-call-markers.ts` — `TOOL_START/END` marker processing and tool evidence normalization

**Persona-memory sub-modules** (extracted from persona-memory.ts):
- `persona-memory/_constants.ts` — `DAY_MS` constant
- `persona-memory/classification.ts` — deterministic memory text classification (class, domain, short-term cues, active-project cues)
- `persona-memory/temporal.ts` — relative-time parsing, expiry resolution, temporal freshness derivation

## Memory Authority Snapshot

- `persona-memory.ts` owns persona clustering, relative-time resolution, temporal freshness, and preference-slot supersession.
- `task-state/continuity.ts` owns project continuity buckets and active-status transitions.
- `chat-files.ts` plus artifact metadata own generated-document lineage.
- `memory-events.ts` owns the normalized persisted event log for cross-domain state changes. Add new event types there instead of introducing side logs inside routes or unrelated services.
- `honcho.ts` mirrors and enriches memory, but it is not the authority for local temporal truth, document lineage, or event history.
- `src/lib/server/db/compat.ts` is the only allowed place for narrowly scoped runtime SQLite compatibility shims when production safety demands them. It is an emergency additive fallback, not a replacement for `npm run db:prepare`.
- `tei-embedder.ts` and `tei-reranker.ts` are transport adapters only. They may improve shortlist and rerank quality, but they are not allowed to become a second authority for document identity, active focus, or temporal truth.
- `semantic-embeddings.ts` owns the durable embedding substrate for artifacts, persona clusters, and task states. Keep source-text hashing, upsert semantics, and readback there instead of reimplementing per-domain mini stores.
- `semantic-embedding-refresh.ts` owns async refresh/backfill orchestration on top of that store. Artifact/task/persona writers may queue refreshes there, and `memory-maintenance.ts` may run user-scoped backfill there, but do not duplicate those loops in routes or domain-specific services.
- `semantic-ranking.ts` owns generic shortlist math over stored embeddings. Domain retrieval services may consume it, but they should keep authority-specific weighting and suppression rules local instead of pushing those concerns down into the generic helper.
- `persona-memory.ts` may also consume `semantic-ranking.ts` for query-time prompt recall, but it must keep temporal freshness, correction penalties, supersession, and overview composition deterministic on its own side of the boundary.
- `task-state.ts` may also consume `semantic-ranking.ts` for query-time task routing, but it must keep task status transitions, locked-task precedence, and project continuity truth deterministic on its own side of the boundary.

**Additional active services not shown above:**
- `auth/hooks.ts` — `requireAuth`, `getBearerToken` (canonical auth boundary for API routes)
- `prompts.ts` (src/lib/server/prompts.ts) — system prompt configs for translation rules (consumed by langflow, honcho)
- `analytics.ts` — analytics event ingestion (consumed by finalize.ts)
- `pdf-generator.ts` — PDF artifact generation from chat content or file generation requests
- `image-search.ts` — image search integration (tool endpoint at api/tools/image-search)
- `ocr/paddle-adapter.ts` — PaddleOCR integration (endpoint at api/ocr/paddle)
- `projects.ts` (src/lib/server/services/projects.ts) — project CRUD using db + schema.ts directly (active service, not legacy)
- `server/api/responses.ts` — shared JSON response helpers for API routes (consumed across route files)
- `webhook-buffer.ts` — sentence-level webhook buffering for streaming turns

**Key insight**: `finalize.ts` is the fan-out point — after a turn completes, it dispatches to persistence, evidence, memory, and Honcho sync.

## Knowledge Store Internal Chain

```
knowledge.ts (facade — re-exports from below)
  ├── store.ts (facade — re-exports from store/*)
  │     ├── store/core.ts         ← artifact CRUD, mapping, WORKING_SET_*_BUDGET
  │     ├── store/attachments.ts  ← upload → extract → dedupe → link
  │     ├── store/documents.ts    ← normalized docs, query matching
  │     └── store/cleanup.ts      ← cross-ref-aware deletion
  ├── context.ts                 ← working-set ranking, compaction status
  └── capsules.ts                ← work capsules, generated outputs
```

**Call chain for attachment upload**: `saveUploadedArtifact()` → `document-extraction.ts` → `store/core.ts createArtifact()` → `store/core.ts syncArtifactChunks()` (delegates to `task-state/artifacts.ts`)

**Library upload note**: knowledge-page uploads may pass `conversationId = null`; `saveUploadedArtifact()` must skip `attached_to_conversation` link creation in that case, while `/api/knowledge/upload` validates any provided conversation id before insert and keeps Honcho sync conversation-bound.

**Document search note**: `searchKnowledgeDocuments()` in `knowledge/store/documents.ts` is the shared document search path used by `/api/knowledge/search` and the shell search modal. Keep ranking and logical-document mapping there instead of duplicating it in routes or client components.

**Chat-generated files note**: `chat-files.ts` is the single source of truth for generated-file storage, conversation-scoped listings, and authenticated user lookups for `/api/chat/files/[id]/download`. Keep `/api/chat/files/generate` bearer-auth logic thin, reject zero-file sandbox runs there instead of returning silent success, and let `chat-files.ts` own file retrieval semantics. The preview route `/api/chat/files/[id]/preview` should stay a binary file endpoint that plugs into the shared rich viewer rather than a separate chat-only text-preview system.

**Working-documents note**: the current working-document foundation should continue to build on existing artifacts, especially `generated_output`. Do not create a second persistence or memory path for generated files separate from artifact metadata, working-set retrieval, the shared document resolver, and Honcho sync. Family lifecycle state such as `documentFamilyStatus` belongs on that same metadata contract.

**Resolver note**: `document-resolution.ts` is now the authority for “which generated document/version is current or relevant”. `working-set.ts`, `knowledge/context.ts`, and `task-state.ts` should consume its result instead of reintroducing ad hoc filename, recency, or latest-output heuristics.

**Capsule note**: `knowledge/capsules.ts` still summarizes workflow, but it is no longer the authority for document lineage. Keep document family/version continuity on artifact metadata plus links, not duplicated capsule payloads.

**Langflow prompt note**: file-generation workflow guidance belongs in `langflow.ts`. Keep its prompt contract aligned with the Langflow file-generator tool: generated code must write files to `/output`, successful files appear in chat, and generic code-execution tools such as `run_python_repl` should not be used as a substitute when `generate_file` is available. The current runtime split is `python` for standard-library-friendly text/data exports and `javascript` for `.xlsx` via `exceljs`, `.pdf` via `pdf-lib`, `.pptx` via `pptxgenjs`, `.docx` via `docx`, and `.odt` via `jszip` packaging.
Authenticated account-level personalization fields such as display name and email should also enter the model prompt through `langflow.ts`, using the current request's authenticated user object instead of ad hoc route-local prompt fragments.

**Generated-file debug note**: when debugging missing chat files, the current server-side log prefixes are `[LANGFLOW]` for outbound request/session correlation, `[FILE_GENERATE]` for the sandbox endpoint and sandbox image warmup/readback warnings, `[CHAT_STREAM]` for tool-call summaries and end-of-stream generated-file handling, `[CHAT_FILES]` for persistence/sync failures, plus `[HONCHO]` and `[MEMORY_MAINTENANCE]` for downstream continuity issues. Extend those prefixes instead of inventing new one-off log tags.
**Selection-debug note**: document and memory observability should stay summary-level. `knowledge/context.ts` now emits `[CONTEXT] Working document selection` with the winning active-state signals and selected artifact ids, while `memory.ts` emits `[KNOWLEDGE_MEMORY] Selected overview source` for Knowledge Memory overview decisions. Extend those summaries instead of reintroducing noisy per-candidate logs.

**Langflow custom-tool note**: for the file generator node, follow Langflow's tool-mode custom-component pattern directly. The agent must see the actual `generate_file` action as the tool; do not expose an intermediate builder method like `build_tool`, or the model may call that method without ever hitting `/api/chat/files/generate`. Keep the source input named `source_code`, not `code`, because Langflow component internals already use `code` and the node can end up posting its own component source instead of the tool argument.

**Persona-memory note**: `persona-memory.ts` now resolves relative-time phrasing such as `in two days` into temporal metadata stored in cluster `metadataJson`, derives `short_term_constraint` and `active_project_context` classes, converts expired temporal memories into historical phrasing on the read path, and performs same-topic temporal supersession before semantic reconcile. Keep those behaviors in the existing cluster pipeline rather than creating a second temporal-memory subsystem.

**Memory-overview note**: `memory.ts` treats Honcho overview text as auxiliary. Local persona clusters remain the authority for temporal freshness and minimum profile readiness, so live/cached Honcho overviews that repeat expired temporal memories or try to speak when there is not enough local durable persona memory must be rejected in favor of the local fallback or empty state.

**Honcho reset note**: cleanup paths that promise a true memory reset must also rotate the per-user Honcho peer version. Deleting sessions, conclusions, cards, and local clusters is not enough if the next chat would still reuse the same Honcho peer id.
**Honcho chat-context note**: the chat prompt path should keep Honcho `session.context(...)` session-limited. Do not send a `searchQuery` there without the required `peerTarget`, do not let live Honcho context quietly broaden into workspace-level retrieval when the intent is current-session recall, and do not call live session context at all for a genuinely empty/new session that has no stored turns or snapshot yet.
**Artifact-ownership note**: artifact reads and cleanup should treat linked conversation ownership as stronger authority than `artifacts.userId` alone. Conversation-scoped working artifacts such as `generated_output` and `work_capsule` are invalid retrieval candidates once their conversation link is gone, even if a stale row still exists.

**Memory-events note**: Wave 2 now persists explicit `memory_events` rows for deadline changes, preference updates, persona fact replacement, project continuity transitions, and generated-document supersession. Use those rows for state-change history and later contradiction/repair work; do not fork that event history into capsule payloads, message metadata, or Honcho-only summaries.
**Behavior-learning note**: Wave 6 behavior signals should also flow through `memory_events`, not a separate analytics-only table. Focused working-document turns now record `document_refined` events, and retrieval may consume recent counts from those events as a bounded boost. Keep those boosts small and recent-windowed; explicit query/document matches still outrank passive behavior history.
**Working-set behavior note**: if behavior learning influences prompt carryover, route it through `working-set.ts` with the same bounded event-derived scores used by retrieval. Do not add a second prompt-only behavior heuristic that can drift away from `document-resolution.ts`.
**Workspace behavior note**: shared workspace opens may also emit `document_opened` events. Treat reopen counts as a smaller-than-refinement, smaller-than-focus signal and keep them on the same document-resolution/working-set rails instead of inventing a parallel “recent files” authority.
**Historical-family note**: `documentFamilyStatus: historical` is a lifecycle signal, not a hard filter. Retrieval and prompt carryover may downrank historical families when the turn is otherwise weak/generic, but explicit query matches, active focus, and source-jump flows should still be able to surface them.
**Correction-salience note**: persona-memory correction handling should stay in `persona-memory.ts` as deterministic cluster metadata plus repaired salience. If a newer persona memory clearly corrects an older overlapping statement, downrank the older cluster until a later reaffirmation updates `lastSeenAt`; do not create a second correction-ranking cache or a route-local override list.

**Project-continuity note**: `task-state/continuity.ts` now interprets the newest `project_started` / `project_paused` / `project_resumed` event when resolving current continuity state. Explicit pause/resume phrasing from the user may write those events during turn finalization, and continuity reads should trust them before an older still-active row.
**Persona-contradiction note**: `persona-memory.ts` now treats high-confidence fact slots such as current location or current role as deterministic contradiction candidates. Use slot metadata plus `supersessionReason`/`memory_events` there instead of broad “latest phrasing wins” heuristics.
**Document-preference note**: task-state evidence preference writes should stay document-family aware. If a user pins or excludes one artifact version inside a working-document family, clear sibling user preference links for that same family so one version remains current for the task.
**Active-state note**: structured live signals such as active workspace focus, explicit user correction phrasing, the most recently refined document family, and explicit move-on/reset phrasing should stay first-class in working-set/prompt selection. Prefer those signals over ad hoc semantic-only rescoring when the user is clearly revising or explicitly leaving a current document.
**Active-state assembly note**: use `active-state.ts` as the shared source for live document focus/correction/current-output/recently-refined-family/reset signals. Avoid rebuilding that logic independently inside `knowledge/context.ts`, `task-state.ts`, or `honcho.ts`, because drift there will make prompt selection and evidence selection disagree about the “current” document.
**Prompt-selection note**: `selectWorkingSetArtifactsForPrompt(...)` must rederive turn-scoped document reason codes from the current active-state before calling generated-document prompt eligibility. Persisted DB reason codes describe the last turn, not the current one.
**Retrieval note**: generated-document retrieval in `knowledge/context.ts` should also follow the shared active-state contract. Keep a preferred/recently refined family active on generic refinement turns, but do not drag in unrelated generated-document families unless the query explicitly matches them, and let reset/move-on phrasing suppress that carryover.
**TEI note**: semantic retrieval work should layer on top of those same contracts. Use `tei-embedder.ts` for shortlist generation and `tei-reranker.ts` for top-N refinement, but keep deterministic filters, document-family authority, active-state resets, and historical-family penalties above the TEI scores.
**Reranker cutover note**: current evidence rerank in `task-state.ts`, chunk rerank in `task-state/artifacts.ts`, historical section rerank in `prompt-context.ts`/`honcho.ts`, and tool/web evidence rerank in `message-evidence.ts` should all stay on the shared TEI reranker path. Do not route those back through the generic control-model chat-completions client.
**Embedding-store note**: keep embedding persistence unified in `semantic-embeddings.ts` + `semantic_embeddings`. Artifact, persona, and task semantic retrieval waves may project different subject types onto that table, but they should not create separate embedding tables unless there is a measured operational reason.
**Embedding-refresh note**: live write paths should queue semantic refreshes asynchronously through `semantic-embedding-refresh.ts`, while slower user-wide backfill belongs in `memory-maintenance.ts`. Do not make artifact creation, task checkpointing, or persona dreaming wait on TEI round-trips.
**TEI diagnostics note**: keep semantic observability compact and shared through `tei-observability.ts`. Document retrieval, persona prompt recall, and task routing may log one retrieval summary with latency/fallback/candidate counts/winner mode, but avoid duplicating those fields under domain-specific ad hoc log formats.
**Document semantic note**: `knowledge/store/documents.ts` is now the artifact-level semantic retrieval path for Wave 5. Let it compose lexical candidate fetch, stored-embedding shortlist, and TEI rerank, then keep generated-family identity/focus/history enforcement in `document-resolution.ts` and `knowledge/context.ts`.
**Persona semantic note**: `persona-memory.ts` may use stored persona-cluster embeddings and bounded rerank scores when selecting prompt-time persona context for a query, but do not turn the Knowledge Memory overview into a second semantic-search surface. Overview composition should still start from the deterministic classified persona items already filtered for freshness and supersession.
**Task semantic note**: `task-state.ts` may use stored task-state embeddings and bounded rerank scores when deciding whether to continue, revive, or create a task for the current turn, but do not let those scores bypass deterministic status rules, locked-task precedence, or project continuity event truth in `task-state/continuity.ts`.
**Preview-performance note**: keep heavy preview dependencies off the idle shell path. `DocumentWorkspace.svelte`, `GeneratedFile.svelte`, and `knowledge/FilePreview.svelte` now lazy-load the rich preview component, markdown renderer, and PDF worker URL; do not revert those paths back to eager imports unless you re-measure the client bundle cost.
**Transport note**: preserve `activeDocumentArtifactId` end-to-end through `streaming.ts`, `/api/chat/stream`, `/api/chat/retry`, and `langflow.ts`. The server-side active-state and retrieval helpers cannot recover a workspace-focused document if the browser/request layer drops that id.
**Repair-loop note**: Wave 5 repair work should reuse the existing generated-output duplicate classifier in `evidence-family.ts` and run it from `memory-maintenance.ts`. Do not invent a parallel “document cleanup” service when retrieval-class repair already compresses low-value duplicate drafts deterministically. The same repair surface now also owns dormant generated-document family downgrades to shared `documentFamilyStatus: "historical"` metadata.
**Salience-repair note**: low-confidence or weakly supported persona memories should lose prominence through the existing `persona-memory.ts` cluster refresh path. Recompute repaired `salienceScore` from stored cluster metadata/support counts there; do not add a separate maintenance-only salience cache or a second persona-ranking subsystem.
