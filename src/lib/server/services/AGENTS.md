# Server Services — Internal Map

Parent: [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) lists every service file and its role. This file covers **cross-service dependencies, complexity ordering, and data flow** — what the parent doesn't document.

## Complexity Hotspots (by line count)

| Rank | File | Lines | Why large |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | `task-state.ts` | ~1,558 | Facade + task routing, evidence selection, checkpointing, steering |
| 2 | `honcho.ts` | ~1,517 | Honcho client lifecycle, session bootstrap, context construction |
| 3 | `stream-orchestrator.ts` | ~558 | Full chat-turn streaming pipeline, neutral model-run event adaptation, downstream AI SDK UI stream framing |
| 4 | `chat-turn/stream.ts` | ~247 | Stream framing and cleanup helpers |
| 5 | `knowledge/store/attachments.ts` | ~520 | Upload auto-rename, readiness checks, artifact linking |
| 6 | `task-state/continuity.ts` | ~989 | Project memory, focus continuity, task-project linking |
| 7 | `knowledge/context.ts` | ~680 | Working-set ranking, context status, compaction logic |
| 8 | `knowledge/capsules.ts` | 347 | Workflow summarization, generated-output artifacts |
| 9 | `knowledge/store/core.ts` | 353 | Artifact CRUD, mapping, token-budget constants |
| 10 | `task-state/artifacts.ts` | 358 | Chunking, prompt-snippet selection, historical summarization |
| 11 | `knowledge/store/cleanup.ts` | 302 | Cross-reference-aware deletion, bulk cleanup |
| 12 | `chat-turn/retry-cleanup.ts` | ~190 | Idempotent cleanup of failed turn data (evidence, checkpoints, work capsules, generated outputs) |

**Chat-turn sub-modules** (extracted from stream.ts):
- `chat-turn/stream.ts` — AI SDK UI stream framing, stream runtime cleanup, native tool-call accumulation, and stream error classification
- `chat-turn/thinking-normalizer.ts` — thinking block/tag stripping and reasoning content extraction

## Memory Authority Snapshot

- `task-state/continuity.ts` owns project continuity buckets and active-status transitions.
- `chat-files.ts` plus artifact metadata own generated-document lineage.
- `memory-events.ts` owns the normalized persisted event log for cross-domain state changes. Add new event types there instead of introducing side logs inside routes or unrelated services.
- `honcho.ts` mirrors and enriches memory, but it is not the authority for local temporal truth, document lineage, or event history.
- `src/lib/server/db/compat.ts` is the only allowed place for narrowly scoped runtime SQLite compatibility shims when production safety demands them. It is an emergency additive fallback, not a replacement for `npm run db:prepare`.
- `tei-embedder.ts` and `tei-reranker.ts` are transport adapters only. They may improve shortlist and rerank quality, but they are not allowed to become a second authority for document identity, active focus, or temporal truth.
- `semantic-embeddings.ts` owns the durable embedding substrate for artifacts, legacy persona-cluster rows, and task states. Keep source-text hashing, upsert semantics, and readback there instead of reimplementing per-domain mini stores.
- `semantic-embedding-refresh.ts` owns async refresh/backfill orchestration on top of that store. Artifact/task/persona writers may queue refreshes there, and `memory-maintenance.ts` may run user-scoped backfill there, but do not duplicate those loops in routes or domain-specific services.
- `semantic-ranking.ts` owns generic shortlist math over stored embeddings. Domain retrieval services may consume it, but they should keep authority-specific weighting and suppression rules local instead of pushing those concerns down into the generic helper.
- `task-state.ts` may also consume `semantic-ranking.ts` for query-time task routing, but it must keep task status transitions, locked-task precedence, and project continuity truth deterministic on its own side of the boundary.

**Additional active services not shown above:**
- `auth/hooks.ts` — `requireAuth`, `getBearerToken` (canonical auth boundary for API routes)
- `prompts.ts` (src/lib/server/prompts.ts) — shared prompt configuration helpers (consumed by normal-chat context, honcho)
- `analytics.ts` — analytics event ingestion plus the Analytics Dashboard Read Model. Event ingestion records usage/conversation facts during chat-turn finalization. `getAnalyticsDashboardReadModel(...)` projects the `/api/analytics` dashboard payload, including personal analytics, admin-only system/per-user analytics, timeline rows, available months, and mock analytics. The route remains an adapter for auth, `mock`/`month`/`systemMonth`/`timeline` query parameters, and `json(...)` mapping.
- `file-production/` — durable generated-file jobs, source validation, renderers, sandbox execution, retry/cancel, storage, and legacy generated-file backfill
- `generated-file-serving.ts` — generated chat-file lookup, ownership fallback, assigned/succeeded-job eligibility, byte/type validation, and preview/download headers for chat routes and Working Document generated-output serving
- `image-search.ts` — image search integration used by direct normal-chat tools
- `projects.ts` (src/lib/server/services/projects.ts) — project CRUD using db + schema.ts directly (active service, not legacy)
- `server/api/responses.ts` — shared JSON response helpers for API routes (consumed across route files)

**Key insight**: `finalize.ts` is the fan-out point — after a turn completes, it dispatches to persistence, evidence, memory, and Honcho sync.

**Analytics Dashboard Read Model note**: keep `/api/analytics` payload assembly in `analytics.ts` behind `getAnalyticsDashboardReadModel(...)`. The route adapter should authenticate, parse query parameters, call the read-model interface, and return JSON; it should not import database tables, Drizzle helpers, provider configuration, or grouping/reducer helpers. Privacy behavior remains governed by the existing Account Erasure boundary and ADR 0029: person-linked analytics may feed authorized dashboard projections while retained aggregate behavior must not become a second analytics privacy policy.

## Knowledge Store Internal Chain

```
knowledge.ts (facade — re-exports from below)
  ├── knowledge/upload-intake.ts ← shared upload limits, conversation validation, completion
  ├── store.ts (facade — re-exports from store/*)
  │     ├── store/core.ts         ← artifact CRUD, mapping, WORKING_SET_*_BUDGET
  │     ├── store/attachments.ts  ← upload → auto-rename → link
  │     ├── store/documents.ts    ← normalized docs, query matching
  │     └── store/cleanup.ts      ← cross-ref-aware deletion
  ├── context.ts                 ← working-set ranking, compaction status
  └── capsules.ts                ← work capsules, generated outputs
```

**Call chain for attachment upload**: upload routes receive bytes or chunk metadata, then call `knowledge/upload-intake.ts`. The intake boundary resolves shared limits, validates any supplied conversation id, calls `saveUploadedArtifact()` / `saveUploadedArtifactFromStoredFile()`, creates normalized artifacts, syncs Honcho with fallback text, and resolves prompt readiness. Store writes still flow through `store/core.ts createArtifact()` → `store/core.ts syncArtifactChunks()` (delegates to `task-state/artifacts.ts`). Text extraction for prompt readiness happens through normalized-document creation, not by turning duplicate uploads into versions.

**Library upload note**: knowledge-page uploads may pass `conversationId = null`; `saveUploadedArtifact()` must skip `attached_to_conversation` link creation in that case. Knowledge upload adapters must use `upload-intake.ts` for provided conversation validation, prompt readiness, and Honcho sync instead of importing conversation, store, or Honcho helpers directly.

**Workspace Search note**: `workspace-search.ts` owns server-backed Workspace Search for `/api/workspace-search`, including conversation title, project, message-body, and openable-document result shaping with server-owned snippets and ranking. It composes logical document listing/search from `knowledge/store/documents.ts`; keep document persistence, grouping, and artifact mapping in the knowledge store instead of duplicating them in routes or client components.

**Chat-generated files note**: `chat-files.ts` owns generated-file storage and conversation-scoped listings. Durable creation requests enter through `/api/chat/files/produce`, while `file-production/` owns intake parsing, source validation, durable job creation/reuse, execution, retry/cancel, storage-adapter linking, and legacy generated-file backfill. `generated-file-serving.ts` owns authenticated generated-file serving for `/api/chat/files/[id]/preview`, `/api/chat/files/[id]/download`, and Working Document generated-output `sourceChatFileId` delegation, including ownership fallback, assigned/succeeded-job eligibility, byte/type validation, and preview/download headers. The preview route should stay a binary file endpoint that plugs into the shared rich viewer rather than a separate chat-only text-preview system.

**Working-documents note**: the current working-document foundation should continue to build on existing artifacts, especially `generated_output`. Do not create a second persistence or memory path for generated files separate from artifact metadata, working-set retrieval, the shared document resolver, and Honcho sync. Family lifecycle state such as `documentFamilyStatus` belongs on that same metadata contract.

**Working Document Selection note**: `working-document-selection.ts` is the authority for live Working Document signal collapse: active workspace focus, current generated document, correction targets, recently refined families, reset/move-on suppression, prompt reason-code projection, retrieval carryover, and task-evidence protection.

**Resolver note**: `document-resolution.ts` is now the authority for “which generated document/version is current or relevant”. `working-document-selection.ts` consumes its generated-family ranking result instead of reintroducing ad hoc filename, recency, or latest-output heuristics.

**Capsule note**: `knowledge/capsules.ts` still summarizes workflow, but it is no longer the authority for document lineage. Keep document family/version continuity on artifact metadata plus links, not duplicated capsule payloads.

**Normal Chat prompt note**: file-production workflow guidance belongs in `normal-chat-context.ts` and the app-owned AI SDK tool boundary. Keep its prompt contract aligned with the unified `produce_file` tool: source-first documents use `document_source`, program artifacts write final files to `/output`, successful work appears in chat as durable job-backed cards, and generic code-execution tools such as `run_python_repl` should not be used as a substitute when `produce_file` is available.
Authenticated account-level personalization fields such as display name and email should also enter the model prompt through the Normal Chat context boundary, using the current request's authenticated user object instead of ad hoc route-local prompt fragments.

**Generated-file debug note**: when debugging missing chat files, the current server-side log prefixes are `[NORMAL_CHAT_CONTEXT]` for prompt-context preparation, `[FILE_PRODUCTION]` for production job lifecycle and validation, `[CHAT_STREAM]` for tool-call summaries and end-of-stream generated-file handling, `[CHAT_FILES]` for persistence/sync failures, plus `[HONCHO]` and `[MEMORY_MAINTENANCE]` for downstream continuity issues. Extend those prefixes instead of inventing new one-off log tags.
**Selection-debug note**: document and memory observability should stay summary-level. `knowledge/context.ts` now emits `[CONTEXT] Working document selection` with the winning Working Document Selection signals and selected artifact ids, while projection-backed Memory Profile paths should use compact `[KNOWLEDGE_MEMORY]` and `[MEMORY_MAINTENANCE]` summaries. Extend those summaries instead of reintroducing noisy per-candidate logs.

**Direct file-production tool note**: normal chat exposes `produce_file` through the app-owned AI SDK tool boundary. The agent must see the actual `produce_file` action as the tool, with `conversationId` supplied by the runtime and only `produce_file` contract fields model-facing.

**Tool execution envelope note**: app-backed Normal Chat tools in `normal-chat-tools/` should use the shared envelope in `normal-chat-tools/shared.ts` for timeout, abort, model-safe failure text, and recorder behavior. Keep each tool adapter focused on input validation, domain execution, output compaction, and evidence metadata.

**Web-grounding note**: `web-grounding.ts` is the Normal Chat authority for compact `research_web` source/evidence payloads, grounded web candidates, grounded metadata, URL canonicalization, and citation-audit source extraction. Keep freshness/search instructions in `normal-chat-context.ts`, but route retrieved web source/evidence shaping and final citation audit handoff through Web Grounding.

**Provider-model runtime defaults note**: `provider-model-runtime-defaults.ts` owns provider-model runtime and persistence defaults for context windows, target constructed context, compaction thresholds, max output tokens, reasoning effort, and thinking mode. Env parsing, `config-store.ts`, `provider-models.ts`, context budgeting, prompt-limit resolution, and Normal Chat Model Run should consume that projection instead of duplicating context ratio math.

**Normal Chat stability snapshot note**: `normal-chat-stability-snapshot.ts` owns aggregate, content-free Normal Chat stability diagnostics: active stream capacity, provider/model readiness, tool timeout/readiness, web-grounding configuration, context-limit validity, and maintenance metric summaries. Admin route adapters may expose it after `requireAdmin`, but must not return prompts, messages, search queries, raw source text, API keys, or user ids.

**Persona-memory note**: persona memory is delegated to Honcho in the current codebase. Do not reintroduce a local `persona-memory.ts` cluster pipeline, route-local persona caches, or a second temporal-memory subsystem.

**Memory Profile note**: `memory.ts` is the public service boundary for the Knowledge Base Memory Profile. It should read the durable Memory Profile Projection from `memory-profile/`, return the same active profile that chat may use for ordinary personalization, and keep `/api/knowledge/memory/overview` as a projection-backed compatibility wrapper. Do not make the Knowledge page depend on live Honcho overview generation, raw Honcho markdown cleanup, task-memory tables, or focus-continuity sections.

**Memory Profile internals note**: keep `memory-profile/index.ts` as the compatibility facade. New server code should prefer the narrow internal seams: `reset-generation.ts` for reset guards, `projection-store.ts` for projection item writes, `read-model.ts` for Knowledge Base read models, `active-context.ts` plus `telemetry.ts` for prompt-context callers, `review.ts` for Guided Memory Review lifecycle, `dirty-ledger.ts` for dirty marking/listing, `dirty-ledger-reconciliation.ts` for bounded maintenance reconciliation, and `legacy-curation.ts` for preserved legacy memory curation. `memory-maintenance.ts` should use reconciliation/legacy-curation seams directly, and ordinary prompt/read paths must not statically load `normal-chat-control-model.ts`.

**Honcho reset note**: cleanup paths that promise a true memory reset must also rotate the per-user Honcho peer version. Deleting sessions, conclusions, cards, or local rows is not enough if the next chat would still reuse the same Honcho peer id.
**Honcho chat-context note**: the chat prompt path should keep Honcho `session.context(...)` session-limited. Do not send a `searchQuery` there without the required `peerTarget`, do not let live Honcho context quietly broaden into workspace-level retrieval when the intent is current-session recall, and do not call live session context at all for a genuinely empty/new session that has no stored turns or snapshot yet.
**Artifact-ownership note**: artifact reads and cleanup should treat linked conversation ownership as stronger authority than `artifacts.userId` alone. Conversation-scoped working artifacts such as `generated_output` and `work_capsule` are invalid retrieval candidates once their conversation link is gone, even if a stale row still exists.

**Memory-events note**: Wave 2 now persists explicit `memory_events` rows for deadline changes, preference updates, persona fact replacement, project continuity transitions, and generated-document supersession. Use those rows for state-change history and later contradiction/repair work; do not fork that event history into capsule payloads, message metadata, or Honcho-only summaries.
**Behavior-learning note**: Wave 6 behavior signals should also flow through `memory_events`, not a separate analytics-only table. Focused working-document turns now record `document_refined` events, and retrieval may consume recent counts from those events as a bounded boost. Keep those boosts small and recent-windowed; explicit query/document matches still outrank passive behavior history.
**Working-set behavior note**: if behavior learning influences prompt carryover, route it through `working-set.ts` with the same bounded event-derived scores used by retrieval. Do not add a second prompt-only behavior heuristic that can drift away from `document-resolution.ts`.
**Workspace behavior note**: shared workspace opens may also emit `document_opened` events. Treat reopen counts as a smaller-than-refinement, smaller-than-focus signal and keep them on the same document-resolution/working-set rails instead of inventing a parallel “recent files” authority.
**Historical-family note**: `documentFamilyStatus: historical` is a lifecycle signal, not a hard filter. Retrieval and prompt carryover may downrank historical families when the turn is otherwise weak/generic, but explicit query matches, active focus, and source-jump flows should still be able to surface them.
**Persona-correction note**: persona correction or deletion requests should go through the Honcho memory actions in `memory.ts`/`honcho.ts`; do not create a route-local override list or revive the removed local salience repair path.

**Project-continuity note**: `task-state/continuity.ts` now interprets the newest `project_started` / `project_paused` / `project_resumed` event when resolving current continuity state. Explicit pause/resume phrasing from the user may write those events during turn finalization, and continuity reads should trust them before an older still-active row.
**Persona-contradiction note**: current persona contradiction handling belongs on the Honcho/memory boundary. Do not recreate broad “latest phrasing wins” heuristics in routes or prompt assembly.
**Document-preference note**: task-state evidence preference writes should stay document-family aware. If a user pins or excludes one artifact version inside a working-document family, clear sibling user preference links for that same family so one version remains current for the task.
**Working Document signal note**: structured live signals such as active workspace focus, explicit user correction phrasing, the most recently refined document family, and explicit move-on/reset phrasing should stay first-class in Working Document Selection. Prefer those signals over ad hoc semantic-only rescoring when the user is clearly revising or explicitly leaving a current document.
**Working Document assembly note**: use `working-document-selection.ts` as the shared source for live document focus/correction/current-output/recently-refined-family/reset signals. Avoid rebuilding that logic independently inside `knowledge/context.ts`, `task-state.ts`, or `honcho.ts`, because drift there will make prompt selection and evidence selection disagree about the “current” document.
**Prompt-selection note**: `selectWorkingSetArtifactsForPrompt(...)` must consume Working Document Selection prompt reason-code views before calling generated-document prompt eligibility. Persisted DB reason codes describe the last turn, not the current one.
**Retrieval note**: generated-document retrieval in `knowledge/context.ts` should also follow the Working Document Selection retrieval view. Keep a preferred/recently refined family active on generic refinement turns, but do not drag in unrelated generated-document families unless the query explicitly matches them, and let reset/move-on phrasing suppress that carryover.
**TEI note**: semantic retrieval work should layer on top of those same contracts. Use `tei-embedder.ts` for shortlist generation and `tei-reranker.ts` for top-N refinement, but keep deterministic filters, document-family authority, Working Document Selection resets, and historical-family penalties above the TEI scores.
**Reranker cutover note**: current evidence rerank in `task-state.ts`, chunk rerank in `task-state/artifacts.ts`, historical section rerank in `prompt-context.ts`/`honcho.ts`, and tool/web evidence rerank in `message-evidence.ts` should all stay on the shared TEI reranker path. Do not route those back through the generic control-model chat-completions client.
**Embedding-store note**: keep embedding persistence unified in `semantic-embeddings.ts` + `semantic_embeddings`. Artifact, persona, and task semantic retrieval waves may project different subject types onto that table, but they should not create separate embedding tables unless there is a measured operational reason.
**Embedding-refresh note**: live write paths should queue semantic refreshes asynchronously through `semantic-embedding-refresh.ts`, while slower user-wide backfill belongs in `memory-maintenance.ts`. Do not make artifact creation, task checkpointing, or persona dreaming wait on TEI round-trips.
**TEI diagnostics note**: keep semantic observability compact and shared through `tei-observability.ts`. Document retrieval, persona prompt recall, and task routing may log one retrieval summary with latency/fallback/candidate counts/winner mode, but avoid duplicating those fields under domain-specific ad hoc log formats.
**Document semantic note**: `knowledge/store/documents.ts` is now the artifact-level semantic retrieval path for Wave 5. Let it compose lexical candidate fetch, stored-embedding shortlist, and TEI rerank, then keep generated-family identity/focus/history enforcement in `document-resolution.ts` and `knowledge/context.ts`.
**Persona semantic note**: the legacy `persona_cluster` embedding subject type may exist in persisted data, but current prompt-time persona recall should stay on the Honcho/memory boundary rather than a revived local semantic-search surface.
**Task semantic note**: `task-state.ts` may use stored task-state embeddings and bounded rerank scores when deciding whether to continue, revive, or create a task for the current turn, but do not let those scores bypass deterministic status rules, locked-task precedence, or project continuity event truth in `task-state/continuity.ts`.
**Preview-performance note**: keep heavy preview dependencies off the idle shell path. `document-workspace/DocumentWorkspace.svelte`, `FileProductionCard.svelte`, `document-workspace/DocumentPreviewRenderer.svelte`, and the `document-workspace/preview-runtime/` adapters lazy-load the rich preview component, markdown renderer, Office/PDF libraries, and PDF worker URL; do not revert those paths back to eager imports unless you re-measure the client bundle cost.
**Transport note**: preserve `activeDocumentArtifactId` end-to-end through `streaming.ts`, `/api/chat/stream`, `/api/chat/retry`, and the Normal Chat model-run/context boundaries. Working Document Selection cannot recover a workspace-focused document if the browser/request layer drops that id.
**Repair-loop note**: Wave 5 repair work should reuse the existing generated-output duplicate classifier in `evidence-family.ts` and run it from `memory-maintenance.ts`. Do not invent a parallel “document cleanup” service when retrieval-class repair already compresses low-value duplicate drafts deterministically. The same repair surface now also owns dormant generated-document family downgrades to shared `documentFamilyStatus: "historical"` metadata.
**Salience-repair note**: do not add a separate maintenance-only salience cache or a second persona-ranking subsystem while persona support is delegated to Honcho.

## Task-State Submodule Flow

**Context assembly path**: `normal-chat-context.ts` requests Prompt Context from `chat-turn/context-selection.ts buildConstructedContext()`; that boundary composes Honcho session/persona candidates from `honcho.ts loadHonchoPromptContext()`, Knowledge candidates, Task-State candidates, Context Budget, and Prompt Context selection. Honcho stays a memory adapter, not the prompt assembler.
